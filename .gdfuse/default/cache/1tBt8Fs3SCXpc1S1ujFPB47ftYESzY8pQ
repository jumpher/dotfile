- Left Wing Right Wing
    - Depends  on what you mean by, "far left." The left/right divide in politics  comes from the French Revolution, wherein the members of the French  National Assembly divided into those who supported the king and the  nobility (the right half of the chamber) and those who supported  liberalism and rights and freedoms for the people (the left half of the  chamber). Liberalism was a relatively new political idea at this time,  the concept that average people should deserve political rights and  freedoms was completely new, since the nobility and royalty had governed  Europe by the divine right of god and with the support of the church  for a thousand years.
    - This is also  where the political meaning of the word, "radical," comes from. A  radical is somebody who does not like an existing political system, and  wants to replace it with a new system. People like the French or  American liberals during the French and American revolutions wanted to  replace the old monarchy and nobility with liberal political freedoms  for all citizens. The United States and Modern France were both  literally founded by radical liberals. Do keep in mind that back then,  in order to be a citizen, you needed to be a white male over the age of  21 who owned a house or land. You could not be a citizen if you were  non-white, if you were non-male, if you were under 21, were homeless,  were a travelling worker, or rented your home form a landlord.
    - People  like Thomas Paine in the US or Robespierre in France were considered  the far left of their time, since they were liberals who believed in a  government that benefitted the people rather than an upper elite.
    - The  industrial revolution came to different parts of the world at different  times, but by the point around the 1820s when the industrial revolution  was underway western Europe and some parts of North America is when the  first socialists emerged. The original goals of liberalism were to use  individual rights, property rights, and individual freedom of choice to  maximize human freedom. Since giving property rights to individuals  would allow more people to be free and serve their government for the  benefit of all, individuals believed that property rights were the best  way to achieve economic prosperity. This was a radical idea when for a  thousand years it was the king or the nobility to controlled all  property, and could give or take anything at will. The first socialists  were radical liberals who believed in the goals of liberalism  (maximizing human freedom) but who believed that property rights failed  to do this, since it allowed small groups of people to hoard massive  amounts of wealth and use their wealth to control others. The first  socialists attempted to create communities where instead of property  belonging to individuals, property belonged to the community at large,  and people democratically voted on how to use it. Look into people like  Robert Owens, Henri Saint-Simone, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and others.  None of these original socialist projects worked, because they never got  enough support to function, or were crushed by the military and police  in their areas as threats to the established liberal states.
    - Then  Marx came along in the 1840s, and many of Marx's earlier writings were  devoted to explaining why those liberal socialist projects had failed,  and why their underlying philosophy was flawed. The discussion of  Marxist philosophy is a huge topic, but Marx' goal was twofold - to  create a new philosophy which allowed for a better analysis and  understanding of how societies, economics, and politics all function,  and to use this new philosophy to explain how a better post-capitalist  and post-liberal society might be achieved.
    - While  Marx has had an undeniable influence on much leftist thought, it is  important to remember that the global left is extremely diverse. Even  while Marx was alive, there was a great split in the European socialist  movement between Marxists who wanted to use the state as a temporary  tool to create a socialist society, and the Anarchists who believed that  the state needed to be abolished immediately in favour of directly  democratic unions and coalitions. By the time that Lenin and his  followers formed the Soviet Union in 1922, Marx had been dead for  decades, and it is still hotly argued over by historians and  philosophers whether or not Marx would have supported what Lenin did. By  the time that Stalin ruled the USSR, Marx's original works were being  censored because Stalin viewed them as a threat to his power. Today you  have millions of leftists around the world with a very broad range of  ideas. Leftist infighting is a meme because leftists tend to be very  passionate and free-thinking, and disagree over the best way to achieve  socialism or what socialism even means.

    - Another answer
    - It's  a little bit hard to say because left wing politics as we would  recognize them today aren't that much older than Marx. When the  left/right split emerges during the French Revolution most of "the left"  would've been classical liberals, i.e. very big on expanding individual  political rights but also generally supportive of free market  economics. It wasn't really until the industrial revolution was in full  swing that a criticism of free market economics was seen as  the left  position.
    - At the time being a  "socialist" didn't necessarily mean that you supported some kind of  collective state or worker owned form of ownership, it just meant that  you were concerned with "the social question," that is, not just  people's political rights but also their economic wellbeing. A lot of  the early socialists like Charles Fourier came up with these extremely  intricate plans for utopian societies that would eliminate poverty and  crime. In general, 19th century leftists were focused on things like  eliminating property qualifications to vote or hold office, getting rid  of any remaining privileges for the nobility or the church, allowing  workers to form unions (which was still illegal in many places), land  reform, banning child labor, establishing the 8 hour workday, and  various policies to make sure that wages were adequate, rents were  bearable, and prices on things like food were affordable. The theory was  that by expanding the right to vote to the working class, they would  inevitably end up supporting economic policies that benefitted them.  They also probably would've supported various "socially liberal" causes  of the day like the abolition of slavery, civil rights for Jews,  religious toleration between catholics and protestants, national  liberation for places like Ireland, Poland, and the Balkans, and a  criticism of European imperialism in Africa and Asia.
    - I  think a good place to illustrate the ideas of the time is the left wing  government of the Paris Commune of 1871. Marx was around to comment on  it but he certainly wasn't the major figure of the left at the time. Two  of the major factions here were the Proudhonists or Mutualist  Anarchists, and what we might call "Neo-Jacobins".
    - The Proudhonists were inspired by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who was arguably the  major ideologue of European socialism before Marx. His vision of the  future was for worker owned cooperatives to exist within a market  system. He's probably most famous today for the slogan "property is  theft," which reflected his belief that private property was based on  exploitation and inherently led to people being unjustly deprived of  things they have a right to. Instead Proudhon believed in an idea of  property rights called "occupation and use," essentially that if an  individual or group is the primary user of something they should own it  (for example the tenants of an apartment building would collectively own  it rather than the landlord, but an individual would still have some  "ownership" over their own apartment.)
    - Notably,  Proudhon wasn't really in favor of revolution and he definitely was not  into the idea of using state power to accomplish his vision. He  believed that these worker cooperatives would more or less form  naturally with the help of private mutual credit banks, and that they  would be so much more efficient and beneficial that they would  eventually replace private businesses by defeating them in the free  market. These cooperatives would mostly refuse to engage with  traditional politics and instead form their own democratic federations.  As this happened all over the world, the old governments would  essentially become irrelevant as all of the power now lay with this  international network of local cooperatives.
    - The  Neo-Jacobins on the other hand were more focused on traditional  politics and less on economics. They saw themselves as continuing on and  expanding the most radical ideas of the original french revolution.  Their biggest concern was universal suffrage, expanding the right to  vote to all men (they were of mixed opinion over whether to expand it to  women) regardless of property ownership or income. The rest of their  platform was things like land reform (breaking up large estates and  either giving them or selling them to small farmers), rent control,  putting price controls on essential commodities like food, establishing  some kind of progressive income tax, and raising wages. They were also  supportive of creating government owned workhouses to combat  unemployment. These are less like the victorian idea of workhouses as a  place for the extreme poor to live in exchange for work, and more like a  jobs guarantee, where basically anyone who needed work would in theory  be able to get a decent wage. They wouldn't have opposed worker  cooperatives, but the thinking was that there wasn't actually that much  the government could or should do to encourage their creation.
    - That  was pretty France-centric but there were more or less equivalent  movements like the Chartists and Owenists in Britain, the left Hegelians  in Germany (this is the group Marx comes out of), the Narodniks in  Russia, and all sorts of social democrats and anarchists all around  Europe.

- Parliamentary Committee
    - **Parliamentary Committee**  means a **Committee**   which is appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker  and which works under the direction of the Speaker and presents its  report to the House or to the Speaker and the Secretariat for which is  provided by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.
    - Representativeness, Responsiveness and Accountability are the foundational pillars of  [Parliamentary democracy](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/parliamentary-vs-presidential-form-of-government). In India, Parliament has broadly two functions, which are lawmaking and oversight of the executive branch of the government.
        - Parliament is the embodiment of the people’s will and parliamentary  committees are an instrument of Parliament for its own effective  functioning.
        - Over the years, the Indian Parliament has increasingly taken recourse to the [parliamentary committee system](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/role-of-parliamentary-committees).  However, data and several other instances show that in the last few  years there has been a gradual marginalisation of the committee system.
        - Hence, for the sake of upholding the Parliament’s primary role i.e  debate, discussion and deliberation, there is need to take necessary  reforms in the parliamentary committee system.
        - Genesis & Types of Parliamentary Committee
        - 
            - Origin: As is the case with several other practices  of Indian parliamentary democracy, the institution of Parliamentary  Committees also has its origins in the British Parliament
            - In independent India, the first Public Accounts Committee was constituted in April 1950.
            - Constitutional Provisions: Parliamentary committees  draw their authority from Article 105 (on privileges of Parliament  members) and Article 118 (on Parliament’s authority to make rules for  regulating its procedure and conduct of business).
            - Types: Most committees are ‘standing’ as their  existence is uninterrupted and usually reconstituted on an annual basis;  some are ‘select’ committees formed for a specific purpose, for  instance, to deliberate on a particular bill.
            - In 1993, 17 [Departmentally-related Standing Committees (DRSCs)](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/extension-of-tenure-of-standing-committees), later increased to 24, were constituted in the Parliament.
            - These committees drew members from both Houses roughly in proportion to the strength of the political parties in the Houses..
            - Allocation of Business: The chair uses her  discretion to refer a matter to a parliamentary committee but this is  usually done in consultation with leaders of parties in the House.
            - The practice of regularly referring bills to committees began in  1989 after government departments started forming their own standing  committees
            - Prior to that, select committees or joint committees of the houses  were only set up to scrutinise in detail some very important bills.
            - Some Important Parliamentary Committees in Finances:  Financial control is a critical tool for Parliament’s authority over  the exeutive; hence finance committees are considered to be  particularly powerful.
            - The three financial committees are the Public Accounts Committee,  the Estimates Committee and the Committee on Public Undertakings.
        - Significance of Parliamentary Committee System
            - Inter-Ministerial Coordination: They are envisaged to be the face of Parliament in a set of inter- related departments and ministries.
            - They are assigned the task of looking into the demands for grants of  the ministries/departments concerned, to examine Bills pertaining to  them, to consider their annual reports, and to look into their long-term  plans and report to Parliament.
        - Instrument For Detailed Scrutiny: Committee reports are usually exhaustive and provide authentic information on matters related to governance.
            - Bills that are referred to committees are returned to the House with significant value addition.
            - Besides the standing committees, the Houses of Parliament set up ad  hoc committees to enquire and report on specific subjects that are  assigned the task of studying a Bill closely and reporting back to the  House.
            - Also, in the discharge of their mandate, they can solicit expert advice and elicit public opinion.
        - Acting As Mini-Parliament: These Committees are smaller units of MPs from both Houses, across political parties and they functin throughout the year.
            - Also, Parliamentary committees are not bound by the populistic demands that generally act as hindrance in working of parliament.
            - As committee meetings are ‘closed door’ and members are not bound by  party whips, the parliamentary committee work on the ethos of debate  and discussions.
            - Moreover, they work away from the public glare, remain informal  compared to the codes that govern parliamentary proceedings, and are  great training schools for new and young members of the House
        - 
        - A Gradual Marginalisation
        - Decline in Matters Referred: According to data by  PRS Legislative Research, while 60% of the Bills in the 14th Lok Sabha  and 71% in the 15th Lok Sabha were referred to DRSCs concerned, this  proportion came down to 27% in the 16th Lok Sabha.
        - Apart from the DRSCs, there are negligible bills referred to Select Committees of the Houses or Joint Parliamentary Committees.
        - The last Bill referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee was The  Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,  Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Second Amendment) Bill, in 2015.
        - Neglected in The Matters of Great Public Importance: Some of the most momentous Acts of Parliament in recent years such as the [overhaul of Article 370](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/article-370-and-35-a-revoked)  that revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divided the  State into two Union Territories were not processed by any House  committee.
        - Recently, even after popular protests against the three Bills  related to agricultural produce and the three labour Bills, that  definitely deserved to be scrutinised by Select Committees of the  Houses, were passed by the government only by using the majority.
        - Other Shortcomings: Other issues affecting the  functioning of the committees are low attendance of MPs at meetings; too  many ministries under a committee; norms not followed by most political  parties while nominating MPs to committees; and the constitution of  DRSCs for a year leaves very little time for specialisations.
        - 
        - Way Forward
        - Setting Up New Committees: Given the increasing  complexity in matters of economy and technological advancement there is a  need for setting up new parliamentary committees. For example:
        - Standing Constitution Committee to scrutinise Constitutional Amendment Bills before they are introduced in Parliament.
        - Standing Committee on Legislations to oversee and coordinate legislative planning. .
        - Standing Committee on National Economy to provide analysis of the national economy with resources for advisory expertise, data gathering and research facilities.
        - Mandatory Discussion: Major reports of all  Committees should be discussed in Parliament especially in cases where  there is disagreement between a Committee and the government.
        - The recommendations of the PACs should be accorded greater weight  and they must be treated as the “conscience-keepers of the nation in  financial matters”.
        - Periodic Review: According to the National  Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC), DRSCs  should be periodically reviewed so that the committees which have  outlived their utility can be replaced with new ones.
        - Amending Rules of Business: Apart from these, there  is need to amend rules of procedure in both Lok sabha and Rajya sabha,  so that all major Bills should be referred to DRSCs so that DRSCs may  finalise the second reading stage in the Committee.
        - Conclusion
        - Primary role of Parliament is deliberation, discussion and  reconsideration, the hallmarks of any democratic institution. However,  Parliament deliberates on matters that are complex, and therefore needs  technical expertise to understand such matters better.
        - Thus, Parliamentary Committees help with this by providing a forum  where Members can engage with domain experts and government officials  during the course of their study. There is a need to strengthen the  parliamentary committees rather than bypassing them for the betterment  of the parliamentary democracy.

- **Lok adalat**
    - Why in News
        - Recently, a daily wager in Odisha’s Kandhamal district has moved the Lok Adalat against the Prime Minister of India but the hearing is yet to begin.
        - He allegedly failed to get an [Aadhaar card](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/aadhar-and-its-voluntary-use)registered in his name despite various attempts due to technical glitches in taking his fingerprint.
    - Key Points
    - About:
        - The term ‘Lok Adalat’ means ‘People’s Court’ and is based on Gandhian principles.
        - As per the [Supreme Court](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/supreme-court-of-india), it is an old form of adjudicating system prevailed in ancient India and its validity has not been taken away even in the modern days too
        - It is one of the components of the [Alternative Dispute Resolution](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/Paper2/alternative-dispute-resolution-adr-mechanisms-paper-2) (ADR) system and delivers informal, cheap and expeditious justice to the common people.
        - The first Lok Adalat camp was organised in Gujarat in 1982 as a voluntary and conciliatory agency without any statutory backing for its decisions.
        - In view of its growing popularity over time, it was given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. The Act makes the provisions relating to the organisation and functioning of the Lok Adalats.
    - Organisation:
        - The State/District Legal Services Authority or the Supreme Court/High Court/Taluk Legal Services Committee may organise Lok Adalats at such intervals and places and for exercising such jurisdiction and for such areas as it thinks fit.
        - Every Lok Adalat organised for an area shall consist of such number of serving or retired judicial officers and other persons of the area as may be specified by the agency organising.
            - Generally, a Lok Adalat consists of a judicial officer as the chairman and a lawyer (advocate) and a social worker as members.
        - [National Legal Services Authority](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-legal-services-day)(NALSA) along with other Legal Services Institutions conducts Lok Adalats.
            - NALSA was constituted under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 which came into force on 9th November 1995 to establish a nationwide uniform network for providing free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society.
    - Jurisdiction:
        - A Lok Adalat shall have jurisdiction to determine and to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties to a dispute in respect of:
            - Any case pending before any court, or
            - Any matter which is falling within the jurisdiction of any court and is not brought before such court.
        - Any case pending before the court can be referred to the Lok Adalat for settlement if:
            - Parties agree to settle the dispute in the Lok Adalat or one of the  parties applies for referral of the case to the Lok Adalat or court is  satisfied that the matter can be solved by a Lok Adalat.
            - In the case of a pre-litigation dispute, the matter can be referred  to the Lok Adalat on receipt of an application from any one of the  parties to the dispute.
        - Matters such as matrimonial/family disputes,  criminal (compoundable offences) cases, land acquisition cases, labour  disputes, workmen’s compensation cases, bank recovery cases, etc. are  being taken up in Lok Adalats.
        - However, the Lok Adalat shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any case or matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law. In other words, the offences which are non-compoundable under any law fall outside the purview of the Lok Adalat.
    - Powers:
        - The Lok Adalat shall have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure (1908).
        - Further, a Lok Adalat shall have the requisite powers to specify its own procedure for the determination of any dispute coming before it.
        - All proceedings before a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings within the meaning of the Indian Penal Code (1860) and every Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purpose of the Code of Criminal Procedure (1973).
        - An award of a Lok Adalat shall be deemed to be a decree of a Civil Court or an order of any other court.
        - Every award made by a Lok Adalat shall be final and binding on all the parties to the dispute. No appeal shall lie to any court against the award of the Lok Adalat.
    - Benefits:
        - There is no court fee and if court fee is already paid the amount will be refunded if the dispute is settled at Lok Adalat.
        - There is procedural flexibility and speedy trial of the disputes. There is no strict application of procedural laws while assessing the claim by Lok Adalat.
        - The parties to the dispute can directly interact with the judge through their counsel which is not possible in regular courts of law.
        - The award by the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties and it has the status of a decree of a civil court and it is non-appealable, which does not cause the delay in the settlement of disputes finally.
    - Permanent Lok Adalats
    - The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was amended in 2002 to provide for the establishment of the Permanent Lok Adalats to deal with cases pertaining to the public utility services like transport, postal, telegraph etc.
    - Features:
        - These have been set up as permanent bodies.
        - It shall consist of a Chairman who is or has been a  district judge or additional district judge or has held judicial office  higher in rank than that of the district judge and two other persons having adequate experience in public utility services.
        - It shall not have jurisdiction in respect of any matter relating to an offence not compoundable under any law. The jurisdiction of the Permanent Lok Adalats is upto Rs. 1 Crore.
        - Before the dispute is brought before any court, any party to the  dispute may make an application to the Permanent Lok Adalat for  settlement of the dispute. After an application is made to the Permanent Lok Adalat, no party to that application shall invoke jurisdiction of any court in the same dispute.
        - It shall formulate the terms of a possible settlement and submit them to the parties for their observations  and in case the parties reach an agreement, the Permanent Lok Adalat  shall pass an award in terms thereof. In case parties to the dispute fail to reach an agreement, the Permanent Lok Adalat shall decide the dispute on merits.
            - A major drawback of the Lok Adalats is that if the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the case is either returned to the court of law or the parties are advised to seek a remedy in a court of law. This causes unnecessary delay in the dispensation of justice.
        - Every award made by the Permanent Lok Adalat shall be final and binding on all the parties thereto and shall be by a majority of the persons constituting the Permanent Lok Adalat.

- Legislative Councils
    - The Council’s journey
        - The Vidhan Parishad of united Andhra Pradesh was created on July 1,  1958, and dissolved on May 31, 1985. It was resurrected after 22 years,  on March 30, 2007. Ironically, it was abolished the last time by N T  Rama Rao, the founder of the TDP, after the Congress blocked all the  government’s decisions in the Council. And it was restored by Dr Y S  Rajashekara Reddy, the father of Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy.
        - Since the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the Council has had  58 members. The TDP’s strength fell to 28 last week after the  resignation of D Manikya Varaprasad. Two Ministers in the Jaganmohan  Reddy government, Deputy Chief Minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose, and  Marketing Minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana are members of the Council.  They will have to resign when the Council is ultimately abolished.
        - That, however, will happen only after Parliament approves the  resolution passed by the Assembly. The Union Law Ministry will prepare a  Bill to be tabled in Parliament. The process may take 3-6 months,  during which time the Council will continue to function.

        - Councils in the Constitution
        - Under Article 168, states can have either one or two Houses of  legislature. Article 169 leaves the choice of having a Vidhan Parishad  to individual states.
        - The Constituent Assembly was divided on having a second chamber in  the states. It was argued that a second House can help check hasty  actions by the directly elected House, and also enable non-elected  persons to contribute to the legislative process. However, it was also  felt that some of the poorer states could ill afford the extravagance of  two Houses.
        - It has been pointed out that the Councils can be used to delay  important legislation, and to park leaders who have not been able to win  an election.
        - Under Article 171, a Council cannot have more than a third of the  number of MLAs in the state, and not less than 40 members. A third of  the MLCs are elected by MLAs, another third by a special electorate  comprising sitting members of local government bodies such as  municipalities and district boards, 1/12th by an electorate of teachers,  and another 1/12th by registered graduates. The remaining members are  appointed by the Governor for distinguished services in various fields.
        - Councils in other states
        - Besides Andhra Pradesh, five other states have Vidhan Parishads —  Bihar (58 members), Karnataka (75), Maharashtra (78), Telangana (40), UP  (100). Jammu and Kashmir had a Council until the state was bifurcated  into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh.
        - In 1986, the M G Ramachandran government in Tamil Nadu abolished the  Council. The DMK government passed a law revive it, but the subsequent J  Jayalalithaa-led government withdrew it after coming to power in 2010.
        - The Odisha Assembly has passed a resolution for a Legislative  Council. Proposals to create Councils in Rajasthan and Assam are pending  in Rajya Sabha.
        - 
        - The parliamentary panel that examined the Rajasthan Bill advocated a  national policy for creation and abolition of Councils: “The status of  Second Chamber cannot be of temporary in nature depending on the mood of  the Government of the day nor can be abolished once created, only at  the whims and fancy of a newly elected Government in the State.”
