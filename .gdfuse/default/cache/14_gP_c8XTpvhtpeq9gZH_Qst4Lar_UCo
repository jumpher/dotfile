- **#Summer solstice occurs when one of the Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. Summer Solstice 2021 will occur on Monday, June 21, 2021. Technically, the solstice occurs when the sun is directly over the imaginary Tropic of Cancer or 23.5°N latitude.  Why is it called Solstice?  The term 'solstice' comes from Latin —'sol' means sun and 'sistere' means to stand still.  Summer Solstice vs Winter Solstice Solstice is an astronomical event that occurs twice in a year, once in summer (June) and once in winter (December).  During June Solstice/Summer Solstice, it is summer time in the UK, the USA, Canada, Russia, India, and China and it is the longest day of the year while it is winter time in Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa and it is the shortest day of the year.  During December Solstice/Winter Solstice, it is winter time in the UK, the USA, Canada, Russia, India and China and it is the shortest day of the year while it is summer time in Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa and it is the longest day of the year.  The solstice officially marks the beginning of the astronomical summer, which ends when the autumn equinox falls on September 22. Day and night will be at almost equal length on this day, as the sun crosses the celestial equator and moves southward into the northern hemisphere**.

- **Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO)**
    - According to India Met Department (IMD), the Arabian Sea arm of south-west monsoon is counting on an itinerant Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) wave for normal[monsoon.](https://www.drishtiias.com/loksabha-rajyasabha-discussions/in-depth-monsoon-respite-for-agriculture)
        - It is an oceanic-atmospheric phenomenon which affects weather activities across the globe. It brings major fluctuation in tropical weather on weekly to monthly timescales.
        - The MJO can be defined as an eastward moving 'pulse' of clouds, rainfall, winds and pressure near the equator that typically recurs every 30 to 60 days.
        - It’s a traversing phenomenon and is most prominent over the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
    - Phases of Madden-Julian Oscillation[Link](https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1567667265_image1.jpg)![](https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1567667265_image1.jpg)
        - The MJO consists of two parts or phases. Strong MJO activity often dissects the planet into halves. One half within the enhanced convective phase and the other half in the suppressed convective phase.
            - 
                - Enhanced rainfall (or convective) phase: winds at the surface converge, and the air is pushed up throughout the atmosphere. At the top of the atmosphere, the winds reverse (i.e., diverge). Such rising air motion in the atmosphere tends to increase condensation and rainfall.
                - Suppressed rainfall phase: winds converge at the top of the atmosphere, forcing air to sink and, later, to diverge at the surface. As air sinks from high altitudes, it warms and dries, which suppresses rainfall.
        - It is this entire dipole structure, that moves west to east with time in the Tropics, causing more cloudiness, rainfall, and even storminess in the enhanced convective phase, and more sunshine and dryness in the suppressed convective phase.
    - How Does MJO Affect Indian Monsoon?
        - The [Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Nino](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/near-normal-monsoon-in-2019-imd) and MJO are all oceanic and atmospheric phenomena, which affect weather on a large scale. IOD only pertains to the Indian Ocean, but the other two affect weather on a global scale-up to the mid-latitudes.
        - IOD and El Nino remain over their respective positions, while MJO is a traversing phenomenon.
        - The journey of MJO goes through eight phases.
            - 
                - When it is over the Indian Ocean during the Monsoon season, it brings good rainfall over the Indian subcontinent.
                - On the other hand, when it witnesses a longer cycle and stays over the Pacific Ocean, MJO brings bad news for the Indian Monsoon.
        - It is linked with enhanced and suppressed rainfall activity in the tropics and is very important for the Indian monsoonal rainfall.
        - Periodicity of MJO:
            - 
                - If it is nearly 30 days then it brings good rainfall during the Monsoon season.
                - If it is above 40 days then MJO doesn't give good showers and could even lead to a dry Monsoon.
                - Shorter the cycle of MJO, better the Indian Monsoon. Simply because it then visits the Indian Ocean more often during the four-month-long period.
        - Presence of MJO over the Pacific Ocean along with an El Nino is detrimental for Monsoon rains.
- 
- El Nino
    - Under ‘normal’ conditions,the west tropical Pacific is warmer than its eastern basin. The warmer area of the ocean is also a source for convection and is associated with cloudiness and rainfall.
    - During El Nino years, the warmth shifts to Central and East Tropical Pacific and along with it, cloudiness and rainfall.
    - El Nino has been found to impact almost half the world triggering droughts in Australia, India, southern Africa and floods in Peru, Ecuador, the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Colorado River basin.
    - However, there is no direct correlation between the ENSO events and the monsoon has been established yet.
        - From 1950 to 2012, there were 16 La Nina years, with the monsoon rains above or around average nearly every time.
        - The 1997-98 El Nino, among the century’s strongest, generated above-average rain. Likewise, 2002 proved to be one of the driest monsoons despite it being a weak to moderate El Nino year.
    - Other acronyms related to El Nino:
        - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) that gives an indication of the development and intensity of El Nino or La Nina.
            - The SOI is calculated on the basis of the atmospheric pressure differences between South Pacific Ocean and Australia.
            - Sustained positive SOI values are indicative of La Nina conditions while negative values suggest El Nino conditions.
        - ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) refers to the oscillation between the El Nino and the La Nina.
            - ENSO shifts irregularly back and forth between El Nino and La Niña every two to seven years.
            - Each phase triggers predictable disruptions of temperature, precipitation, and winds disrupting large-scale air movements in the tropics, triggering a cascade of global side effects.
- 
- **Air Flow**  and **Monsoon**
    - **At**  night the land is cooler than water due to the fact that the land gets cooler and heater faster than the water. So **at night**  the **air**  over the water has higher temperature than that of land.So the **air**  over water rises upwards. Due to which a low pressure **area**  is created over the water .
    - In coastal areas, during daytime, there **is**  a regular **flow**  of cool **air**  from the sea towards the land. At **night** , there **is**  a reverse **flow**  of **air**  from land to sea. This happens because during the daytime, land gets heated faster than water and radiated heat from land, heats the **air**  above it.
    - **Cold air flows**  downward according to **hot air**  because it **is**  more dense and sinks while **hot air**  rises. In **hot**  room the **air**  will be much thinner thus reducing the pressure so the **air flows**  from **cold**  room to **hot**  rooms.
    - **Air does**  indeed **flow**  from high pressure to low pressure area (see the wind arrows on a weather chart), but in the case of two rooms the much more important effect is that of warm thinner **air**  rising towards the ceiling when the **air**  from the two rooms gets mixed
    - Consequently, monsoon winds typically travel from sea to land in [summer](https://www.britannica.com/science/summer-season)  and from land to sea in [winter](https://www.britannica.com/science/winter) .
    - For example, the heat source involved in the [Indian summer](https://www.britannica.com/science/Indian-summer)  monsoon resides over the [Plateau of Tibet](https://www.britannica.com/place/Plateau-of-Tibet)  and the eastern foothills of the [Himalayas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Himalayas) , while the heat sink occurs over the southern [Indian Ocean](https://www.britannica.com/place/Indian-Ocean)  and Madagascar, a region where relatively cloud-free [air](https://www.britannica.com/science/air)  cools by emitting [infrared](https://www.britannica.com/science/infrared-radiation) , or “long-wave,” radiation into space.
    - What is a Jet Stream?
        - The Jet Stream is a geostrophic wind blowing horizontally through the upper layers of the troposphere, generally from west to east, at an altitude of 20,000 - 50,000 feet.
        - Jet Streams develop where air masses of differing temperatures meet. So, usually surface temperatures determine where the Jet Stream will form.
        - Greater the difference in temperature, faster is the wind velocity inside the jet stream.
        - Jet Streams extend from 20 degrees latitude to the poles in both hemispheres.
    - Genesis of Jet Streams
    - The genesis of the Jet-streams is provided by three kinds of gradients:
        - Thermal gradient between pole and equator
        - Pressure gradient between pole and equator
        - Pressure gradient between surface and subsurface air over the poles.
    - Where does it actually begin?
        - Air when warmed in the tropics, around the equator, fuel the Jet Stream as it rises. Hitting the tropopause at about 58,000 feet (the layer of the atmosphere separating the troposphere from the stratosphere), it is drawn toward the colder air at the north and south poles.
    - Types of Jet Streams
        - Sub Tropical Jet Streams are best developed in winter and early spring. Their maximum speed approaches 300 knots which are associated with the merger with polar-front jets. A subsidence motion accompanies subtropical jets and gives rise to predominantly fair weather in areas they pass over. Sometimes they drift northward and merge with a polar-front jet.
        - Tropical Easterly Jet Stream occurs near the tropopause over Southeast Asia, India, and Africa during summer. This jet implies a deep layer of warm air to the north of the jet and colder air to the south over the Indian Ocean. The difference in heating and cooling and the ensuing pressure gradient is what drives this jet.
        - Polar-Night Jet Stream meanders through the upper stratosphere over the poles. They are present in the convergence zone above the sub polar low pressure belt.

    - Climatic Significance of Jet Stream
        - At times, Jet Streams bring about some moisture to the stratosphere, leading to the formation of Noctilucent clouds (tenuous cloudlike phenomena in the upper atmosphere which are made of ice crystals visible in a deep twilight.)
        - Plays a significant role in the onset and withdrawal of [monsoon](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/paper1/monsoon-2) winds.
        - Known to have brought some ozone depleting substances to stratosphere which result in ozone layer depletion.
        - Intensifies alternative cyclonic and anticyclonic conditions with the crust and trough formation in its movement.
        - When the air mass is moving, it undergoes alternate expansion and compression which means that it is associated with alternative high pressure and low pressure.
    - Characteristics of Jet Streams
        - Its genesis is associated with the thermal contrast of air cells, for example Hadley cell, Ferrel cell.
        - The meandering or the whirl movement of the Jet Stream is called ‘Rossby Wave’.
        - Equatorial extension of the Jet Stream is more in winter because of the southern shift of the pressure belts.
        - During winters, the thermal contrast increases and the intensity of the high pressure centre at the pole increases. It intensifies the formation of Jet Streams, its extension as well as its velocity.
    - Indian Monsoon Mechanism and the Role of Sub Tropical Jet Streams
        - The burst of monsoons depends upon the upper air circulation which is dominated by Sub Tropical Jet Streams (STJ).
        - The south west monsoon coming in India is related to tropical easterly stream. It blows between 8 degree- 35 degree North latitudes.
        - The north east monsoon (winter monsoon) is related to the subtropical westerly Jet Stream which blows between 20 degree and 35 degree latitudes in both hemispheres.
    - [Link](https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/463image1.jpg)![](https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/463image1.jpg)
    - Seasonal Migration of STJ
        - In winter, STJ flows along the southern slopes of the Himalaya and in summer shifts northwards dramatically, flowing along the edge of Himalayas in early June and in late summer (July-August) along the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.
        - The periodic movement of the Jet Stream often indicates the onset and subsequent withdrawal (STJ returns back to its position – south of Himalayas) of the monsoon.
        - Northward movement of the subtropical jet is the first indication of the onset of the monsoon over India.
    - STJ in Summer
        - With the beginning of summer, the STJ [upper westerlies] start their northward march.
        - The weather over northern India becomes hot, dry and squally due to larger incoming solar radiation and hot winds like loo.
        - Over India, the Equatorial Trough (ITCZ) moves northwards with the weakening of the STJ south of Tibet, but the burst of the monsoon does not take place until the upperair circulation has switched to its summer pattern.
        - By the end of May the southern jet breaks and later it is diverted to the north of Tibet Plateau. There is sudden burst of monsoons (the ridge moves northwards into Central Asia, the high pressure zone over north-west India moves northwards into Central Asia making way for south-west monsoon winds).
        - The clockwise cyclic origin in the middle of the troposphere begins in the winds rising up from the plateau of Tibet after it becomes too hot. While going up separates near tropopause. One of these blows in the form of the easterly Jet Stream towards the equator and the other blows in the form of the westerly Jet Stream towards the poles.
        - Western and eastern jets flow to north & south of Himalayas respectively. The eastern jet becomes powerful and is stationed at 15° N latitude.
        - The easterly winds become very active in the upper troposphere and they are associated with westerly winds in the lower troposphere (south-west monsoon winds).
        - This results in more active southwest monsoon and heavy rainfall is caused. The plateau of Tibet and central Asia becoming too hot is considered for its origin.
        - It is to be noted that the westerly Jet Stream begins to settle down in the Arabian sea by blowing in the south west direction and also creates a very high pressure belt there. Inversely, when this hot Jet Stream blows over the Indian sub continent, it pulls up the surface air and creates a very low pressure there. To fill up the low pressure, winds from high pressure area of the Arabian Sea begins to blow towards in the north east direction- known as the southwest monsoon.
    - STJ in Winters
        - The winter subtropical westerly Jet Stream blows from the west to the east in the entire west and middle Asia
        - It is bifurcated by the Himalayan ranges and Tibetan Plateau. One of the branch blows parallel to the plateau from the north while the other moves towards the east in the south of the Himalayas.
        - The western disturbance which enter the Indian subcontinent in winter are brought by these westerly winds.
        - The southern branch blows to the south of the Himalayan ranges along 25° north latitude.
    - How Does It Trigger The North East Monsoon?
        - The westerly Jet Stream, a cold wind which pushes down wind to the surface creating a high pressure on the surface.
        - Dry winds from this high pressure area (north western part of India) start blowing towards the low pressure area (Bay of Bengal).
        - These winds in turn bring cold waves in winter in the northern part of the country including UP and Bihar.
        - After reaching the Bay of Bengal, westerly under the influence of Ferrel’s cell take the form of north east monsoon.
        - When this wind reaches the coast of Tamil Nadu, it causes rainfall with the humidity received from the Bay of Bengal.

- The Types of Monsoons
    - A monsoon is a seasonal wind system that shifts its direction from summer to winter as the temperature differential changes between land and sea. Monsoons often bring torrential summer rains, such as on the Indian subcontinent where the summer monsoon delivers three-quarters of the country's annual precipitation. But sometimes the shift in wind directions can bring a "dry monsoon," which can mean drought in regions where the prevailing winds blow moisture offshore.
    - Monsoon Cycles
        - In India, Australia and other equatorial regions, monsoons move from cold, high pressure systems to warmer areas of less resistance with low atmospheric pressure. Thus in hot summer months as the land heats up, monsoons blow inland from the sea. Come winter, the ocean retains its warmth while the land cools rapidly, and the monsoons head back out to sea. This change in direction establishes a seasonal pattern of rainfall that many farmers depend on in monsoon regions.
        - Summer Monsoons
            - The summer monsoons in India typically blow from the southwest, bringing huge amounts of rain from the Indian Ocean to the warmer land. Some high-elevation areas of India receive up to 500 centimeters (200 inches) of rain from June to September alone. Similar to summer monsoons across the globe, the rains of the Indian summer monsoon are produced as winds push moisture-laden air high into the atmosphere, where it condenses and falls in heavy precipitation.
        - Dry Monsoons
            - In the cooler winter months, the direction of monsoon winds changes as it shifts to follow the warm air back out to sea. As moisture leaves the cooling land, the "dry monsoon" season can be responsible for extensive drought in some regions. But the winter season is not as uniform as the summer monsoons and, according to the Indian state of Maharashtra's Department of the Environment, northeastern India near the Himalayas receives half of its annual precipitation during this time, and even the southwestern states of Kerala and Karnataka receive rain until December.
        - Embryo Monsoons
            - Although true monsoons are associated with the equatorial tropics, some weather patterns at higher latitudes are similar to monsoon rains, earning the moniker of "embryo monsoons." Central Europe, for example, experiences severe summer thunderstorms, and winds can change direction from summer to winter, but the weather events are sporadic and lacking in prevailing monsoonal patterns. Similarly, central Mexico and parts of the American Southwest receive heavy seasonal rains, but consistent winds are not present as the harbinger of a true monsoon.

- Sahyadri Range
    - Anaimudi (2,695 m), the highest peak of Peninsular  plateau is located on the Anaimalai hills of the Western Ghats followed  by Dodabetta (2,637 m) on the Nilgiri hills.
    - Most of the Peninsular rivers such as Krishna and Cauvery have their origin in the Western Ghats.
    - The Western Ghats are a north-south chain of mountains or hills that mark the western edge of the Deccan plateau region.
    - Western Ghats are locally known by different names such as Sahyadri in Maharashtra, Nilgiri hills in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Anaimalai hills and Cardamom hills in Kerala.
    - Western Ghats are comparatively higher in elevation and more  continuous than the Eastern Ghats. Their average elevation is about  1,500 m with the height increasing from north to south.

- **Transhumance **
    - the action or practice of moving livestock from  one grazing ground to another in a seasonal cycle, typically to lowlands  in winter and highlands in summer.
    - Transhumance is a type of pastoralism or nomadism, a seasonal  movement of livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures. In  montane regions, it implies movement between higher pastures in summer  and lower valleys in winter. Herders have a permanent home, typically in  valleys.

- **Jhuming **
    - **Jhum**  cultivation  also called slash and burn agriculture is a form of crop-growing  farming activity. Crops are grown in this cultivation by clearing the  trees and other vegetation and then burning the fields
- Karewa
    - Karewas are lacustrine deposits.  According geographers, the Karewa Formation are glacio-  fluvial-lacustrine and aeolian loess of Plio-Pleistocene age.
        - In other words, these lacustrine deposits are witness to and treasure  of many human civilizations and habitations. The Stone Age man has  survived the harshest of the Pleistocene glaciations. The artefacts left  by him are still embedded in the deep soil horizons of the plateau  lands. Sediments kept coming in through rivers and kept on depositing in  that lake, thus resulting in the formation of a lacustrine plain. Over  the time the water drained away leaving behind deposits viz.  unconsolidated gravel and mud. These deposits are known as KAREWA.
    - The Kashmir valley is known for Karewa deposits. The thickness of  karewas is about 1400 m. It lies between the Pre Panjal Range and the  Great Himalayan Range, in Northwest India. Geologists believe that  region of Kashmir valley was filled with water of Tethys Sea but with  the passage of time, many earthquakes came and a part of baramulla range  broken down that resulted in emptying of water from the valley leaving  behind the moulds of karewas. These crews are widespread in the west of  river Jhelum in the valley.
    - Economic significance of Karewa deposits
        - The Karewa deposits are composed of sand, silt, clay, shale, mud,  lignite, gravel and loessic sediments. Therefore, it is extremely  important for agricultural and horticultural practices in the valley.  The world famous variety of saffron, which is locally known as zafron is cultivated on this deposits. It also helps in the cultivation of almond, walnut, apple and orchards.
        - The unrestrained and violent anthropogenic erosion since a couple of  years has reduced these plateau lands into ugly ravines. Thus we need to  preserve this geological treasure and legacy for the generations to  come.
    - The  Kashmir valley is an oval-shaped basin, 140 km long and 40 km wide,  trending in the NNW–SSE direction. It is an intermountain valley fill,  comprising of unconsolidated gravel and mud. A succession of plateaus is  present above the Plains of Jhelum and its tributaries. These  plateau-like terraces are called ‘ __** Karewas’ **__   or ‘ __** Vudr’ **__   in  the local language. Despite continuous erosion since millions of years,  more than half of the valley is still occupied by the  __** Karewa **__  .

        - Thus, **** __** Karewas **__  are  lacustrine deposits (deposits in lake) in the Valley of Kashmir and in  Bhadarwah Valley of the Jammu Division. These are the flat topped mounds  that border the Kashmir Valley on all sides. They are characterized  with fossils of mammals and at places by peat.

        - 
        - **** __** Karewas **__  were formed during the Pleistocene Period (1  million years ago), when the entire Valley of Kashmir was under water.  Due to the rise of Pirpanjal, the drainage was impounded and a lake of  about 5000 sq. km area was developed and thus a basin was formed.  Subsequently, the lake was drained through Bramulla gorge. The deposits  left in the process are known as **** __** karewas **__ . The thickness of karewas is about 1400 m.
            - The **** __** karewas **__  have been elevated, dissected and removed by subaerial denudation to be in the present position.
        - The **** __** Karewa **__  deposits in the Kashmir valley have been  conventionally divided into two stages, lower and upper, representing  argillaceous and arenaceous facies respectively. The upper **** __** Karewas **__  are less fossiliferous than the lower **** __** Karewas **__ . The entire belt touching the foothills of the Pirpanjal represents the lower **** __** Karewas **__ ,  which has been exposed to the rivers starting from the south such as  Veshav, Rembiara, Romushu, Dodhganga, Shaliganga, Boknag nar and Ningli.  Lower Karewa sections at Aharbal, Anantnag, Arigam, Baramulla have been  exposed by these rivers.

        - The rest of the Karewa sediments occupy the middle of the entire flank  of the valley, including Pampore, Srinagar, Burzuhom, Dilpur, Pattan,  Parihaspora, and parts of Baramulla District. These represent upper  Karewas of the valley. The late Cenozoic deposits exposed in the Kashmir  valley assume special significance as they are extensively  fluvioglacial, fluvial, lacustrine and eolian in origin. The age  determination of a Karewa is based on the correlation between Karewa and  Shiwalik fauna from India and Pakistan. As far as the age of Karewas is  concerned, the lack of chronological control has impeded the  development of a detailed reconstruction of the Karewas depositional  history in the intermountain basin of the valley.
