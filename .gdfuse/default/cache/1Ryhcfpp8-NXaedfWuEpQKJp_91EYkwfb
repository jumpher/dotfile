- ^^Juneteenth^^ is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. It is also often observed for celebrating African-American culture. Originating in Galveston, Texas, it has been celebrated annually on June 19 in various parts of the United States since 1866.

- ^^Rani ki vav^^  is a [stepwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwell)  situated in the town of [Patan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patan,_Gujarat)  in [Gujarat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat)  state of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) . It is located on the banks of [Saraswati river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati_River,_Gujarat) . Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, daughter of [Khengara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khengara)  of Saurashtra, queen of the 11th-century [Solanki dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanki_dynasty)  and spouse of [Bhima I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima_I) . Silted over, it was rediscovered in 1940s and restored in 1980s by the [Archaeological Survey of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_Survey_of_India) . It has been listed as one of [UNESCO's World Heritage Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites_in_India)  since 2014.

- ^^Challenge vote ^^
    - When the identity of a voter is challenged by the agent of a political party, the presiding officer will collect a security money from the political agent, who is challenging the identity of the voter and the amount will be as stipulated in the Presiding Officers manual, thereafter the presiding officer will ask the voter to produce any testimonials, that will prove the voter's identity beyond doubt. If the voter is successful in that, to the satisfaction of the P.O then the voter will be allowed to cast his vote and the political party agent's security deposit will be forfeited. This vote is known as challenge vote.
    - But, if the voter fails to satisfy his identity as the person as named in the electoral roll, he will not be allowed to cast his vote. The political agent will get back the security deposit . The PO may hand over the impersonating voter to police for necessary suitable action.
- ^^Tender ^^^^vot^^e
    - Suppose Mr. X has come to vote but the first polling officer says, that his vote has already been cast. In that case, if the presiding officer is satisfied about identity of the voter Mr X's vote will be taken in a ballot paper and kept separately. The tender vote is not accepted in EVMs. These votes will not be counted if the results will not be different without counting those.
    - Suppose in a constituency, the number of tender votes is 500. But without counting the tender votes, if it is found that a candidate has won by a margin of more than 500 votes (say 1000 votes) then the tender votes will not be counted. But suppose, the winning margin is less than the total no. of 500 hundred tender votes,— In that case the tender votes will be counted and taken into account for determining the results .
- For both the challenge vote and tender vote, official procedures have to be followed. Challenge vote is accepted in EVMs but tender votes are always in ballots.

- ^^Paramahansa Mandali ^^was founded by Dadoba Panderung (1842-82) and Bal Shastri Jambhekar of Maharashtra in 1849. Dadoba in his book Dharma Vivechan, outlined seven principles of this new movement: that God alone should be worshipped; real religion is based on love and moral conduct; spiritual religion is one; every individual should have freedom of thought; our actions and speech should be consistent with reason; mankind is one caste; and the right kind of knowledge should be given to all. These principles denied polytheism of popular Hinduism, the caste system and the Brahmanical monopoly of knowledge. All members were required to take a pledge that they would abandon caste restrictions and take food and drink prepared by a member of a lower caste.
    - The Paramahansa Mandali met in secret. “Its insistence on remaining a secret organisation illustrated an unwillingness to openly challenge Hindu orthodoxy.” Young educated Brahmans from Maharashtra joined the Mandali, but the movement collapsed after 1860.

It was also critical of the [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress)  and its moderate methods which was viewed as aiding the Raj. Its target audience was the young, literate and politically motivated youth of Bengal, and was priced at one [paisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisa) .The paper rapidly acquired a broad popularity, at one time having a readership of 20,000. [Bhupendranath Dutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhupendranath_Dutt)  served as the editor of the newspaper till his arrest in 1907, although it also published articles from a number of noted Bengali revolutionaries including Barindra Kumar Ghosh and [Aurobindo Ghosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurobindo_Ghosh) . It faced prosecution a number of times by the British Indian government for publishing seditious articles. Bhupendranath Dutt was arrested in 1907 for publication of articles "inciting violence against the Government of India", for which he was sentenced to a year's rigorous imprisonment. The paper was ultimately forced to shut down in down in 1908, amidst financial ruins following the prosecutions, and after the passage of The Newspapers (Incitement to offences) act in June 1908 which made its position vulnerable.

- ^^RO stands for Reverse Osmosis^^. It is a process that helps RO water purifier remove unwanted ions, dissolved solids and TDS from the water. Reverse osmosis is the opposite of osmosis. In osmosis, solvent passes through a semi-permeable membrane from a less concentrated solution to a more concentration solution. In reverse osmosis, the solvent passes through the semi-permeable membrane in the opposite direction (from more concentrated solution to low concentrated solution). The pressure required to move solvent (water) from more concentration solution (tap water) to low concentration solution (purified water) is generated by the pump of the RO water purifier.

- ^^**Agrarian Structure**^^** **
    - **Agrarian structure**  is the pattern of [land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land)  (area group) distribution among [landholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landholders)  ([agricultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture)  households).
- 
- 
- ^^**Jagirdars**^^ and ^^**Zamindars**^^
    - The Jagirdars
    - The Jagirdars were the king’s officials who enjoyed the land gifted from  the King. They were the rank (mansab) holder given by the king called  mansabdar. They were allotted non-inheritable land area equivalent to  their fee amount called Jagir.
    - These Jagirs are temporary in character and the Jagirdars only have  the right to claim and enjoy the revenue collected from the land. The  mansabs allotted were not the same for each year and revised from time  to time i.e. Jagirdars got promotion or demotions. Jagirdar having more  land area under him was more powerful and enjoyed the police  jurisdiction as well. The major portion of the land was in the form of  Jagirs.
        - The Jagirdars were not the permanent holder of land so they tried to  collect as much revenue possible from the land. The peasants and  Zamindars come under the Jagirdar. The Jagirdar had right to remove a  Zamindar, detain the peasants and brought them back in case they ran  away.
    - The Zamindars
        - The holder of land is termed as the Zamindar. They had the hereditary  right over the land to claim share in the peasant’s output other than  land revenues. They also have the right to detain the peasants. In most  of the Mughal period the Zamindar collected land revenue from the actual  tillers of land and for this they were allowed one tenth of the  collections either in cash or an equivalent amount of tax free land.
        - Zamindari right was also sold and bought like goods. Persons like  petty officials who accumulated wealth through grant of revenue  converted themselves into zamindars. Zamindari right could also be  mortgaged to money-lenders. Sometimes peasants of a Village also sold  away their right to a person who became the zamindar of that village.
- 
- ^^**Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF),**^^ which is a set of farming methods, and also a grassroots peasant movement, has spread to various states in India. It has attained wide success in southern India, especially the southern Indian state of Karnataka where it first evolved. A rough estimation for just Karnataka puts the figure there at around 100,000 farmer families1 , while at the national level, ZBNF leaders claim that numbers could run into millions. This has been achieved without any formal movement organization, paid staff or even a bank account. ZBNF inspires a spirit of volunteerism among its peasant farmer members, who are the main protagonists of the movement.
    - The neoliberalization of the Indian economy led to a deep agrarian crisis that is making small scale farming an unviable vocation. Privatized seeds, inputs, and markets are inaccessible and expensive for peasants. Indian farmers increasingly find themselves in a vicious cycle of debt, because of the high production costs, high interest rates for credit, the volatile market prices of crops, the rising costs of fossil fuel based inputs, and private seeds. More than a quarter of a million farmers have committed suicide in India in the last two decades. Various studies have linked farmer’s suicides to debt. Debt is a problem for farmers of all sizes in India. Under such conditions, ‘zero budget’ farming promises to end a reliance on loans and drastically cut production costs, ending the debt cycle for desperate farmers. The word ‘budget’ refers to credit and expenses, thus the phrase 'Zero Budget' means without using any credit, and without spending any money on purchased inputs. 'Natural farming' means farming with Nature and without chemicals.
    - 
    - The four pillars of ZNBF 
^^**1. Jivamrita/jeevamrutha **^^is a fermented microbial culture. It provides nutrients, but most importantly, acts as a catalytic agent that promotes the activity of microorganisms in the soil, as well as increases earthworm activity; During the 48 hour fermentation process, the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria present in the cow dung and urine multiply as they eat up organic ingredients (like pulse flour). A handful of undisturbed soil is also added to the preparation, as inoculate of native species of microbes and organisms. Jeevamrutha also helps to prevent fungal and bacterial plant diseases. Palekar suggests that Jeevamrutha is only needed for the first 3 years of the transition, after which the system becomes self-sustaining.
        - How to prepare jeevamrutha: Put 200 liters of water in a barrel; Add 10 Kg fresh local cow dung and 5 to 10 liters aged cow urine; Add 2 Kg of Jaggery (a local type of brown sugar), 2 Kg of pulse flour and a handful of soil from the bund of the farm. Stir the solution well and let it ferment for 48 hours in the shade. Now jeevamrutha is ready for application. 200 liters of jeevamruta is sufficient for one acre of land. Jeevamrutha Application Apply the jeevamrutha to the crops twice a month in the irrigation water or as a 10% foliar spray
    - ^^**2. Bijamrita/beejamrutha **^^is a treatment used for seeds, seedlings or any planting material. Bijamrita is effective in protecting young roots from fungus as well as from soil-borne and seedborne diseases that commonly affect plants after the monsoon period. It is composed of similar ingredients as jeevamrutha - local cow dung, a powerful natural fungicide, and cow urine, a strong anti-bacterial liquid, lime, soil.
        - Bijamrita Application as a seed treatment Add Bijamrita to the seeds of any crop: coat them, mixing by hand; dry them well and use them for sowing. For leguminous seeds, just dip them quickly and let them dry.
    - ^^**3. Acchadana - Mulching**^^. According to Palekar, there are three types of mulching
        - ^^a. Soil Mulch^^: This protects topsoil during cultivation and does not destroy it by tilling. It promotes aeration and water retention in the soil. Palekar suggests avoiding deep ploughing. 
^^b. Straw Mulch^^: Straw material usually refers to the dried biomass waste of previous crops, but as Palekar suggests, it can be composed of the dead material of any living being (plants, animals, etc). Palekar's approach to soil fertility is very simple – provide dry organic material which will decompose and form humus through the activity of the soil biota which is activated by microbial cultures. 
^^c. Live Mulch^^ (symbiotic intercrops and mixed crops): According to Palekar, it is essential to develop multiple cropping patterns of monocotyledons (monocots; Monocotyledons seedlings have one seed leaf) and dicotyledons (dicots; Dicotyledons seedlings have two seed leaves) grown in the same field, to supply all essential elements to the soil and crops. For instance, legumes are of the dicot group and are nitrogen-fixing plants. Monocots such as rice and wheat supply other elements like potash, phosphate and sulphur
    - ^^**4. Whapasa - moisture**^^: Palekar challenges the idea that plant roots need a lot of water, thus countering the over reliance on irrigation in green revolution farming. According to him, what roots need is water vapor. Whapasa is the condition where there are both air molecules and water molecules present in the soil, and he encourages reducing irrigation, irrigating only at noon, in alternate furrows ZBNF farmers report a significant decline in need for irrigation in ZBNF.
    - 
- Other important principles of ZBNF and points to note 
1. ^^Intercropping^^ – This is primarily how ZBNF gets its “Zero Budget” name. It doesn’t mean that the farmer is going to have no costs at all, but rather that any costs will be compensated for by income from intercrops, making farming a close to zero budget activity. Palekar explains in detail the crop and tree associations that work well for the south Asian context. 52 Profiles on Agroecology: Zero Budget Natural Farming in India Case study provided by La Via Campesina Contact: lvcweb@viacampesina.org 
2. ^^Contours and bunds^^ – To preserve rain water, Palekar explains in detail how to make the contours and bunds, which promote maximum efficacy for different crops. 
3. ^^Local species of earthworms^^. Palekar opposes the use of vermicompost. He claims that the revival of local deep soil earthworms through increased organic matter is most recommended. 
4. ^^Cow dung^^- Accroding to Palekar, dung from the Bos indicus (humped cow) is most beneficial and has the highest concentrations of micro-organisms as compared to European cow breeds such as Holstein. The entire ZBNF method is centred on the Indian cow, which historically has been part of Indian rural life.
- 
- ^^**Outcomes of the practices**^^ A survey carried out by LVC suggests that ZBNF works not just in agronomic terms, but also brings about a variety of social and economic benefits. A majority of respondents reported that by adopting ZBNF, over time they saw improvements in yield, soil conservation, seed diversity, quality of produce, household food autonomy, income, and health. Most experienced reduced farm expenses and a reduced need for credit, one of the major problems plaguing Indian farmers.

- ^^**Kolkhoz**^^
    - a collective farm in the former Soviet Union.
    - [Kolkhozes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkhoz) , or [collective farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming) , were regarded for a long time as an intermediate stage in the transition to the ideal of state farming. While [kolkhozy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkhoz)  were typically created by combining small individual farms together in a cooperative structure
- ^^**Sovkhoz**^^
    - a sovkhoz would be organized by the state on land confiscated from former large [estates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_(house) )  (so-called "state reserve land" that was left over after distribution  of land to individuals) and sovkhoz workers would be recruited from  among landless rural residents. The sovkhoz employees would be paid  regulated wages, whereas the remuneration system in a kolkhoz relied on  cooperative-style distribution of farm earnings (in cash and in kind)  among the members.
    - It is usually contrasted with [kolkhoz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkhoz) ,  which is a collective-owned farm. Unlike the members of a kolkhoz,  which were called "kolkhozniks" or "kolkhozniki" (колхозники), the  workers of a sovkhoz were only colloquially called "sovkhozniki".

These labourers fulfilled their obligations  with labour time or in-kind produce at first, and later by cash payment  as commercial activity increased. Manorialism is sometimes included in  the definition of feudalism.
