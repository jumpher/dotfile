        - 
            -

            - Gradually,  there was a shift from reconstruction to development with a particular  emphasis on infrastructure, power grids, roads and transportation, dams,  etc.
            - The other  institutions such as the IDA, IFC, etc. were formed over the years and  all five institutions (IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID) came to be  called the World Bank Group.
            - Currently, the group engages in multifarious activities through its institutions and funds.
            - There is a special focus on developing and underdeveloped countries.

        - India and the UN
    - India  was among the founding members of the United Nations. Even before  achieving independence, India had signed the Declaration by the United  Nations at Washington, D.C. in 1944, and also participated in the United  Nations Conference on International Organization at San Francisco from  25 April to 26 June 1945. As one of the original members of the United  Nations, India enthusiastically supports the purposes and principles of  the UN and has made significant contributions in implementing the goals  of the organisation. The UN field  networks in India are the largest anywhere in the world through the  many offices, programmes and funds currently at work in the country.
    - Today,  there are 26 UN agencies in India. Some of the milestones that the UN  has made in India through its agencies are elaborated upon below:
    - 
        - Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):
            - When FAO began its India operations in 1948, its priority was to  transform India’s food and farm sectors through technical inputs and  support for policy development.
            - Over the years, FAO has made major inroads in resolving issues such  as access to food, nutrition, livelihoods, rural development and  sustainable agriculture. With the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/sustainable-development-goals/) in full swing, the FAO’s primary focus will be on improving India’s sustainable agricultural practices.
        - International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD):
            - IFAD and the Government of India have achieved significant results in investing in the commercialization of smallholding-agriculture and building small farmers’ capacity to increase incomes from market opportunities.
            - IFAD-supported projects have also provided women with access to  financial services, such as by linking women’s self-help groups with  commercial banks.
        - UNAIDS:
            - India has worked with the UN on the Joint United Nations Programme on [HIV/AIDS](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/hiv/) (UNAIDS). The  main aim of the programme is to help prevent new HIV infections, care  for people living with HIV and mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
            - Between 2001 and 2012 the total number of cases of the disease in  India fell down by 50%, one of the highest in the world at that time. So  far, India has managed to continue the trend.
        - Asian and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology (APCTT):
            - This is a UNESCAP regional institute established in 1977. It works  in the fields of technology transfer, information and innovation  management.
        - International Monetary Fund: India has been working closely with the IMF. For more on this, please check the linked article on IMF in the table above.
        - UNESCO:
            - India has been closely associated with the UNESCO. India has been  continuously re-elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO since 1946.
            - A UNESCO Category I Institute dedicated to education for peace and  sustainable development was established in 2012 and is called the  Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable  Development (MGIEP). It is located in New Delhi.
            - There are also several [UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/unesco-world-heritage-sites-india-for-upsc-prelims-exam/). For more on this, click the linked article.
        - World Health Organisation (WHO): WHO has been  working closely with the Indian government to improve health outcomes.  It has played a stellar part in eradicating several diseases such as  cholera, controlling others like malaria, TB, etc. For more on WHO and  India, you can check the WHO linked article from the table above.
    - Similarly, other organisations have also  played a great role in India and helped in its progress towards  development, health and economic improvement. For details of each  organisation’s role in India, you can go through the respective articles  from the table above.
    - India’s Contribution towards the UN
    - India has been an active member of the  UN since its inception. In 1946, India became the first country to raise  the issues of racism and apartheid in South Africa in the UN forum.
    - India played an important part in the drafting of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Read more about the contribution of  [Hansa Mehta](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/this-day-in-history-jul03/) in this regard.
    - The first woman president of the UNGA was an Indian, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, in 1953.
    - India’s contribution to the UNSC can be read at the UNSC article from the first table on this page.
    - India has contributed immensely to UN Peacekeeping Missions in various parts of the world.
    - India has sent her peacekeeping troops to Korea, Egypt, Congo,  Haiti, Angola, Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda, Lebanon, South Sudan, etc.
    - India has been regularly one of the largest contributor of troops to the missions.
    - Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals of non-violence resonate deeply with the  UN’s principles. In 2007, the UN declared Gandhi’s birth anniversary of  October 2 as the ‘International Day of Non-violence’.
    - In 2014, the UNGA declared that 21st June would be observed as [International Yoga Day](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/international-yoga-day/). Read more on this in the linked article.
    - UN Reforms/What are the challenges faced by the UN?
    - The UN has had its fair share of  challenges in the years of its existence. Now there is no one single  factor to those challenges but rather multi-faceted factors that make  the UN’s task of fostering world peace a difficult one. Some of the  challenges to the UN’s efforts for global peace are as follows:
    - 
        - Geopolitical aggression and intransigence:  Conflicts are becoming commonplace and gradually being magnified by  rival global powers as they lend support to proxy groups to wage war  overseas. The UNSC, being dominated by a few nations, is unable to take a  neutral stand on issues, thus endangering world peace and security.  Apart from issuing declarations, the UN has been unable to stop certain  conflicts from taking place.
        - Legacies of military intervention and regime change:  Framed as interventions to counter terror, save civilians or remove  rogue regimes, in case after case, military intervention and regime  change have failed to bring lasting stability or to defeat  fundamentalist groups. This has brought an atmosphere of distrust  regarding any intervention done by the UN.
        - Panic over forced displacement: As desperate people  flee war zones, the impact of forced displacement is hitting  neighbouring countries hardest and they are trying to manage as best as  they can. Meanwhile, Western governments are making hasty deals to  support border and security forces in transit countries to close their  borders and shut the problem out. But such short-term measures will only  further antagonize the nations who are overburdened by the inflow of  refugees.
        - Struggling humanitarianism: Undoubtedly  humanitarians have a tough job. The UN and others are making enormous  efforts, with inadequate resources, to assist the victims of conflict.  But they are not yet good enough at defending humanitarian values,  working for prevention during a crisis or empowering those affected by  humanitarian crises to take the initiative.
        - Western interventions in countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,  etc. have not brought about lasting peace or stability to those regions.  The UN has largely been like a mute spectator to the horrible events  (humanitarian crises, woes of migrants who flee these zones) that  unfolded in these conflict-ridden zones of the world. Although, it must  be acknowledged that many humanitarian efforts such as by the WHO,  UNICEF, WFP, etc. have helped these zones immensely at least in their  respective domains. However, political resolutions to conflicts are more  tricky and the UN does face enormous challenges in this regard.
        - UNSC Reforms: There have been great demands for reforms within the Security Council. The G4 Nations comprising  India, Germany, Brazil and Japan are championing each other’s bid for  permanent seats in the Security Council. You can read more on the [United Nations Security Council Reforms](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/the-united-nations-security-council-reforms-upsc-notes/)  in the linked article. Not only in the UNSC, world leaders are also  demanding a change in the manner in which the UN system functions,  calling for more localisation, lesser bureaucracy and more  decision-making powers to those nations where most of the UN’s  humanitarian work is concentrated, like the African countries.
    - Like all challenges, there are solutions  to face them as well. Here are a few solutions on how the UN works for  conflict resolution and peaceful change in an era of mistrust and  division.
        - In an era where a consensus, political or otherwise, is hard to  arrive at, it will be crucial to use the vision and the mandate of the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This consensus was developed  through a uniquely consultative process.
        - ‘Sustaining peace’ should also be a moment to reclaim the policy space. A  panic regarding policy is setting in – framing conflicts as ‘terror’  threats and as a ‘migration’ crisis is only enlarging the problem. Prevention and peacemaking tools are the answer to these problems.
        - The UN must not settle for an inert and technocratic approach  focused only on building the capacity of state institutions, no matter  how strong or weak the political pressure. At the heart of the SDGs is  a drive for transformative change with more peaceful, just and inclusive  societies helping to shape stronger and more inclusive institutions. If  sustaining peace merely means reinforcing the very institutions that  are at the heart of the problem – such as blood-thirsty military regimes  or corrupt bureaucracies – then, such an endeavour is an exercise in  futility.
        - Remaining true to an agenda that will transform people’s lives requires supporting those who work for peaceful change –  in and out of government, including women and youth. This requires a  willingness to step out of national capitals, to talk to a wider range  of people, to build up an understanding of conflicts rooted in people’s  priorities, and to work in solidarity with people to help them.
        - These reforms are of utmost importance as the world faces newer  challenges in the form of climate change, environmental degradation,  population growth, refugee and stateless peoples, etc.

        - 
        - The UNSC has 15 member states, five of whom are permanent members.
        - The 10 non-permanent members are elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years each, on a regional basis.
            - Out of the  10 temporary members, five are from Asia or Africa, two are from Latin  America, one from Eastern Europe, and two from Western Europe or other  regions.
            - The five permanent member countries are the USA, the UK, France, Russia, and China.
            - Decisions  are taken by the Council by vote, that is if 9 out of the 15 members  vote ‘yes’. However, if any of the permanent members vote ‘no’, that is,  use their veto power, then the resolution is not passed.
            - Each of the permanent members possesses the Veto Power to any resolution of the UNSC.
                - This is seen as the most undemocratic feature of the UN.
                - But, during the formation of the UN, the USA refused to be a part of the UN unless it was given the power to veto.
                - The League  of Nations was an ineffective organization partly because of the  absence of the US. Hence, this condition of the US was accepted.
                - Critics of  the permanent members’ veto power also opine that it is this feature  that prevents many conflicts from being resolved.
        - The members of the UNSC must carry out the decisions taken by the Council; they are legally binding.
        - The UNSC is headquartered in New York.
    - Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
    - The  ECOSOC is the main body responsible for coordination, policy dialogue,  policy review and recommendations on social, economic, and environmental  issues, and also the implementation of internationally agreed  development goals.

        - 
        - It serves  as the central mechanism for activities of the UN system and its  specialized agencies in the economic, social, and environmental fields,  supervising subsidiary and expert bodies.
        - It is the UN’s pivotal platform for reflection, debate, and innovative thinking on sustainable development.
        - The ECOSOC has 54 members that are elected by the General Assembly.
        - Voting is by a simple majority and each member has one vote in the ECOSOC.
        - The work of the UN’s specialized agencies like the FAO, [UNESCO](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/united-nations-educational-scientific-and-cultural-organization-unesco/), UNICEF, the ILO, etc. are coordinated by the ECOSOC.
        - The ECOSOC presidency is for one year, and it is headquartered in New York.
    - Trusteeship Council
    - The  Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 under the UN Charter to  administer the 11 Trust Territories after the Second World War.
    - 
        - 
        - These were former colonies or dependent territories.
        - Since the Council was created, many territories have become independent and are self-governing.
        - The last Trust Territory to become independent was Palau in 1994.
        - Hence, the Trusteeship Council suspended operations in 1994 and decided to meet as and when the occasion arises.

            - Promote greater cooperation in multilateral institutions.
            - Widespread concern at the inadequacy of the existing multilateral institutions to deliver results or meet new challenges.

            - 
        - India and UNSC
        - India  has been trying to make its way into the list of permanent members of  the UNSC but has not been successful. Despite India being a country with  a huge population, a growing economy, and nuclear power, it is not a  permanent member of the UNSC.
        - India is  one among the G4 countries (India, Germany, Japan, Brazil), which gives  it an edge at becoming one of the permanent members of the UNSC. Given  below is a list of claims raised by India to ensure its place as one of  UNSC’s permanent members:
    - 
        - 
        - India is the fastest-growing economy in the world.
        - India has recently acquired the status of a Nuclear Weapons State.
        - India is the second-largest in terms of population and the largest liberal democracy in the world.
        - The country ranks high in purchasing power parity and is a huge contributor to UN Peacekeeping Missions.
        - For  India to become a permanent member, apart from garnering the minimum  required votes from the other United Nations members, India would need  to mend its way with all the UN countries in order to get the required  votes.
        - Roadblocks in Getting a Permanent Seat at UNSC
    - 
        - Although  it may seem like a simple process, it is made difficult by the  objections of certain permanent members of the Security Council. China,  in particular, has been blocking India’s push for a permanent seat at  the Council. China believes that granting India a permanent seat at the  UNSC will lead to Indian interests being of paramount importance in the  geopolitics of the subcontinent, a sentiment echoed by its ally,  Pakistan.
        - In addition to this, India is also seen  as a proliferating nuclear power. Analysts believe that this is the  single most factor that is being a roadblock for India’s UNSC dreams.
        - To grant it a permanent seat without  asking for any steps to cap its nuclear capabilities is an exercise in  futility. As of late 2019, France has become the latest to join other  nations in pushing for India’s permanent UNSC seat, but with the  permanent 5 members obstinate about India having to give up its nuclear  capabilities to join, India being a permanent member of the UNSC seem  like a distant dream.

- ^^International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)^^
    - Topics Covered: Important International institutions, agencies and fora, their structure, mandate.
    - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR):
    - Context:
    - The independent experts on the Human Rights Committee have published a fresh interpretation of the right of peaceful assembly, offering comprehensive legal guidance about where and how it applies and also outlining governments’ obligations.
    - Background:
    - The committee is tasked with monitoring how countries implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which under Article 21 guarantees the right to peaceful assembly.
    - What’s the issue?
    - Authorities  worldwide are grappling with swelling demonstrations over issues like  political rights and racial justice. At some places, coercive forces are  being used to suppress the voices of protesters.
        - Therefore, right to peaceful assembly has come into the spotlight.
        - Supporters believe that protesting peacefully, online or in person, is a fundamental human right.
    - Important observations made by the Human Rights Committee:
        - It  is a “fundamental human right” for people to gather to celebrate or to  air grievances, “in public and in private spaces, outdoors, indoors and  online.”
        - Everyone, including children, foreign nationals, women,  migrant workers, asylum seekers and refugees, can exercise the right of  peaceful assembly.
        - Governments could not prohibit protests by making “generalised references to public order or public safety, or an unspecified risk of potential violence”.
        - In addition, Governments “cannot block internet networks or close down any website because of their roles in organising or soliciting a peaceful assembly”.
        - It also stressed the right of journalists and human rights observers to monitor and document any assembly, including violent and unlawful ones.
    - Implications:
    - The Committee’s interpretation will be important guidance for judges in national and regional courts around the world, as it now forms part of what is known as ‘soft law’.
    - About ICCPR:
        - It is a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
        - Monitored by the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
        - The covenant commits its parties to respect the civil and political rights of individuals,  including the right to life, freedom of religion, freedom of speech,  freedom of assembly, electoral rights and rights to due process and a  fair trial.
        - The ICCPR is part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)  and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
        - It became effective in 1976.
- ICC
    - Governed by an international treaty called 'The Rome Statute', the ICC is the world’s first permanent international criminal court.
    - It investigates and, where warranted, tries individuals charged with  the gravest crimes of concern to the international community: genocide,  war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.
    - Through international criminal justice, ICC aims to hold those  responsible for their crimes and to help prevent these crimes from  happening again.
    - India is not a party to Rome Statute along with US and China.
    - Recently Malaysia has ratified the Rome Statute and became the 124th State party to the ICC.
    - History
        - On 17 July, 1998 Rome Statute was adopted by 120 States in direction of creating a more just world.
        - On 1 July, 2002 Rome Statute took effect upon ratification by 60 states, officialy establishing the ICC. Since it has no retroactive jurisdiction, the ICC deals with crimes committed on or after this date.
        - After 2010 amendments – the Rome Statute also sets new standards for victims' representation in the Courtroom, and ensures fair trials and the rights of the defence.
        - Today the ‘Rome Statute’ serves as the ICC's guiding legal  instrument, which is elaborated in such other legal texts as the  Elements of Crimes, Rules of Procedure and Evidence and more.
    - Facts and Figures
        - Today the ICC has over 900 staff members from approximately 100 States.
        - It has 6 official languages: English, French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Spanish.
        - ICC has 6 field offices: Kinshasa and Bunia  (Democratic Republic of the Congo, "DRC"); Kampala (Uganda); Bangui  (Central African Republic, "CAR"); Nairobi (Kenya), Abidjan (Côte  d'Ivoire).
        - It has 2 working languages: English and French.
        - ICC Headquarters at The Hague, the Netherlands.
        - There have thus far been 27 cases before the Court, with some cases having more than one suspect.
        - 16 people have been detained in the ICC detention centre.
        - The judges have issued 8 convictions and 3 acquittals.
    - Organisation Structure
    - The Assembly of States Parties provides management oversight for the  Court, including electing judges and the Prosecutor and approving the  ICC’s budget.
    - Four organs of the ICC
        - Presidency conducts external relations with States,  coordinates judicial matters such as assigning judges, situations and  cases to divisions, and oversees the Registry's administrative work.
        - Judicial Divisions (18 judges in 3 divisions) Pre-Trial, Trial and Appeals – conduct judicial proceedings
        - Office of the Prosecutor conducts preliminary examinations, investigations, and prosecutions.
        - Registry conducts non-judicial activities, such as security, interpretation, outreach, support to Defence and victims' lawyers etc.
    - Trust Fund for Victims provides assistance, support and reparations to victims.
    - The ICC has field offices in several of the countries in which investigations are being conducted.
    - The ICC detention centre is used to hold in safe, secure and humane custody those detained by the ICC.
    - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is the Detention  Centre's inspecting authority and as such has unrestricted access and  examine, on unannounced visits.
    - 
    - Jurisdiction and Working of Court
    - The Rome Statute, grants the ICC jurisdiction over four main crimes:
        - 
        - The crime of Genocide
        - Crimes against Humanity
        - War crimes
        - Crime of Aggression
    - The Court may exercise jurisdiction in a situation where genocide,  crimes against humanity or war crimes were committed on or after 1 July 2002,
    - The crimes were committed by a State Party national, or in the territory of a State Party, or in a State that has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court;
    - The crimes were referred to the ICC Prosecutor by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) pursuant to a resolution adopted under chapter VII of the UN charter.
    - As of 17 July 2018, a situation in which an act of aggression would  appear to have occurred could be referred to the Court by the Security  Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter,  irrespective as to whether it involves States Parties or non-States  Parties.
    - The ICC is intended to complement, not to replace, national criminal systems; it prosecutes cases only when States do not are unwilling or unable to do so genuinely.
    - ICC is not a UN organization but is has a cooperation agreement with the United Nations.
    - When a situation is not within the Court’s jurisdiction, the United Nations Security Council can refer the situation to the ICC granting it jurisdiction. This has been done in the situations in Darfur (Sudan) and Libya.
    - Other Facts related to Legal Process
    - 
        - The ICC does not prosecute those under the age of 18 when a crime was committed.
        - Before the Prosecutor can investigate, he/she must conduct a  preliminary examination considering such matters as sufficient evidence,  jurisdiction, gravity, complementarity, and the interests of justice.
        - When investigating, the Prosecutor must collect and disclose both incriminating and exonerating evidence.
        - The defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof lies with the Prosecutor.
        - During all stages of proceedings (Pre-Trial, Trial and Appeals), the  defendant has the right to information in a language he or she fully  understands, thus the ICC proceedings are conducted in multiple  languages, with teams of interpreters and translators at work.
        - Pre-Trial judges issue warrants of arrest and ensure there is enough evidence before a case can go to trial.
        - During the Pre-Trial phase, the defendant is referred to as a  suspect. Once the case is committed to trial, since at that point the  charges have been confirmed, the defendant is referred to as the  accused.
        - Trial judges hear the evidence from the Prosecutor, Defence, and the  Victims’ lawyers, render a verdict, and if a person is found guilty,  the sentence and decision on reparations.
        - Appeals judges render decisions on appeals from the Prosecutor or Defence.
        - If a case is closed without a verdict of guilt, it can be reopened if the Prosecutor presents new evidence.
    - 
    - Limitations
    - 
        - As a judicial institution, the ICC does not have its own police force or enforcement body;  thus, it relies on cooperation with countries worldwide for support,  particularly for making arrests, transferring arrested persons to the  ICC detention centre in The Hague, freezing suspects’ assets, and  enforcing sentences.
        - This State cooperation is problematic for several  reasons. It means that the ICC acts inconsistently in its selection of  cases, is prevented from taking on hard cases and loses legitimacy.
        - It also gives the ICC less deterrent value, as potential  perpetrators of war crimes know that they can avoid ICC judgment by  taking over government and refusing to cooperate.
        - There is insufficient checks and balances on the authority of the ICC prosecutor and judges.
        - ICC has been accused of being a tool of Western imperialism and biased in favour of powerful countries against weak states.
        - ICC cannot impose a death sentence; it can impose lengthy terms of imprisonment of up to 30 years or life when so justified by the gravity of the cases.
        - The ICC court has no retrospective jurisdiction as it can deal only with crimes committed after 1 July 2002 when the 1998 Rome Statute came into force.
        - ICC has automatic jurisdiction only for crimes committed on the territory of a state  which has ratified the treaty; or by a citizen of such a state; or when  the United Nations Security Council refers a case to it.
        - Procedural and substantive deficiencies leading to delays and frustration, have questioned the efficacy of the court.
        - It also faces scarcity of human resources and funds.
        - India and ICC
    - India did not signed the Rome Statute, and thus, is not a member of ICC because of following reasons:
    - 
        - State sovereignty
        - National interests
        - Difficulty in collection of evidences
        - Problem to find impartial prosecutors
        - Crime definition
        - 
    - Way Forward
    - 
        - States should actively encourage cooperation with ICC and support  human rights defenders working towards international justice and the  fulfilment of the ICC’s mandate.
        - To enhance its credibility the court needs to broaden its ambit by  including more permanent members of UN and by strengthening of  investigations and prosecutions.
        - ICC role is very important as international justice can contribute  to long‐term peace, stability and equitable development in post‐conflict  societies.
        - Having said so it is also important to know that the ICC actively  works to build understanding and cooperation in all regions through  seminars and conferences worldwide.
- ICJ
    - ICJ was established in 1945 by the United Nations charter and started working in April 1946.
    - It is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, situated at the Peace Palace in The Hague (Netherlands).
    - Unlike the six principal organs of the United Nations, it is the only one not located in New York (USA).
    - It settles legal disputes between States and gives advisory opinions  in accordance with international law, on legal questions referred to it  by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.
    - It has 193 state parties and current President is Ronny Abraham.
    - 
        - Background
        - Article 33 of the United Nations Charter lists the  negotiation, enquiry, mediation etc. methods for the pacific settlement  of disputes between States. Some of these methods involve the services  of third parties.
        - Historically, mediation and arbitration preceded judicial settlement.  The former was known in ancient India and the Islamic world, whilst  numerous examples of the latter can be found in ancient Greece, in  China, among the Arabian tribes, in maritime customary law in medieval  Europe, and in Papal practice.
        - The modern history of international arbitration:
            - The first phase is generally recognized as dating back from the so-called Jay Treaty of 1794 between the United States of America and Great Britain.
            - The Alabama Claims arbitration in 1872 between the United Kingdom and the United States marked the start of a second, even more decisive, phase.
            - The Hague Peace Conference of 1899, convened on the  initiative of the Russian Czar Nicholas II, marked the beginning of a  third phase in the modern history of international arbitration.
            - 
        - With respect to arbitration, the 1899 Convention provided for the creation of permanent machinery, known as the Permanent Court of Arbitration, established in 1900 and began operating in 1902.
        - The Convention also created a permanent Bureau, located in The Hague,  with functions corresponding to those of a court registry or  secretariat, and laid down a set of rules of procedure to govern the  conduct of arbitrations.
        - Various plans and proposals submitted between 1911 and 1919, both by  national and international bodies and by governments, for the  establishment of an international judicial tribunal, which culminated in  the creation of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) as an integral part of the new international system set up after the end of the First World War.
        - In 1943, China, the USSR, the United Kingdom and the United States  issued a joint declaration recognizing the necessity “of establishing at  the earliest practicable date a general international organization,  based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving  States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for  the maintenance of international peace and security”.
        - Subsequently, G.H. Hackworth (United States) committee was entrusted with preparing a draft Statute for the future international court of justice in 1945.
        - The San Francisco Conference while keeping committee recommendations  in mind decided against compulsory jurisdiction and in favour of the  creation of an entirely new court, which would be a principal organ of  the United Nations, on the same footing as the General Assembly, the  Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship  Council and the Secretariat.
        - The PCIJ met for the last time in October 1945 and resolved to transfer its archives and effects to the new International Court of Justice, which, like its predecessor, was to have its seat at the Peace Palace.
        - In April 1946, the PCIJ was formally dissolved, and  the International Court of Justice, meeting for the first time, elected  as its President Judge José Gustavo Guerrero (El Salvador), the last  President of the PCIJ.
        - 
        - Structure
        - 
            - The Court is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for terms of office of nine years by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. These organs vote simultaneously but separately.
            - In order to be elected, a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes in both bodies.
            - In order to ensure a measure of continuity, one third of the Court  is elected every three years and Judges are eligible for re-election.
            - ICJ is assisted by a Registry, its administrative organ. Its official languages are English and French.
            - The 15 judges of the Court are distributed in following regions:
                - Three from Africa.
                - Two from Latin America and Caribbean.
                - Three from Asia.
                - Five from Western Europe and other states.
                - Two from Eastern Europe.
            - Unlike other organs of international organizations, the Court is not composed of representatives of governments. Members of the Court are independent judges  whose first task, before taking up their duties, is to make a solemn  declaration in open court that they will exercise their powers  impartially and conscientiously.
            - In order to guarantee his or her independence, no Member of the  Court can be dismissed unless, in the unanimous opinion of the other  Members, he/she no longer fulfils the required conditions. This has in  fact never happened.
            - Indian Judges at the ICJ
            - 
                - Judge Dalveer Bhandari: Member of the Court since 27 April 2012
                - Raghunandan Swarup Pathak: 1989-1991
                - Nagendra Singh: 1973-1988
                - Sir Benegal Rau: 1952-1953
        - Jurisdiction and Functioning
        - 
            - ICJ acts as a world court with two fold jurisdiction i.e. legal disputes between States submitted to it by them (contentious cases) and requests for advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by United Nations organs and specialized agencies (advisory proceedings).
            - Only States which are members of the United Nations and which have  become parties to the Statute of the Court or which have accepted its  jurisdiction under certain conditions, are parties to contentious cases.
            - States have no permanent representatives accredited to the Court.  They normally communicate with the Registrar through their Minister for  Foreign Affairs or their ambassador accredited to the Netherlands.
            - When they are parties to a case before the Court they are  represented by an agent. Since international relations are at stake, the  agent is also as it were the head of a special diplomatic mission with  powers to commit a sovereign State.
            - The judgment is final, binding on the parties to a case and without appeal (at the most it may be subject to interpretation or, upon the discovery of a new fact, revision).
            - By signing the Charter, a Member State of the United Nations  undertakes to comply with the decision of the Court in any case to which  it is a party.
            - A State which considers that the other side has failed to perform  the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court  may bring the matter before the Security Council, which is empowered to  recommend or decide upon measures to be taken to give effect to the  judgment.
            - The procedure described above is the normal procedure. However, the  course of the proceedings may be modified by incidental proceedings.
            - ICJ discharges its duties as a full court but, at the request of the parties, it may also establish ad hoc chambers to examine specific cases.
            - Advisory proceedings before the Court are only open to five organs  of the United Nations and 16 specialized agencies of the United Nations  family or affiliated organizations.
            - Opinions provided by the court in advisory proceedings are essentially advisory and not binding.
            - Kulbhushan Jadhav Case
            - 
                - Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 by Pakistani security  forces in Balochistan province after he reportedly entered from Iran.
                - He was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on the charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.
                - India has always maintained that Kulbhushan Jadhav is not a spy, and  that Pakistan should provide counsellor access to him as his case  pertains to abduction from the Iranian territory.
                - In May 9, 2018, ICJ has stayed his death sentence after India had  moved a petition before the UN body to seek justice for him, alleging  violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations by Pakistan.
                - During the latest hearing in the case on February, 2019, India said  Pakistan's continued custody of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav  without any consular access should be declared "unlawful" as it was an  egregious violation of the Vienna Convention.
                - Harish Salve, who is representing India and Kulbhushan Jadhav in the  ICJ, said Pakistan was using the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav as a  "propaganda tool" without even following the due proper procedure.
                - 
        - Limitation on the Functioning of ICJ
        - 
            - ICJ suffers from certain limitations, these are mainly structural,  circumstantial and related to the material resources made available to  the Court.
            - It has no jurisdiction to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. As it is not a criminal court, it does not have a prosecutor able to initiate proceedings.
            - It differs from the Courts which deal with allegations of violations  of the human rights conventions under which they were set up, as well  as applications from States at which courts can entertain applications  from individuals, that is not possible for the International Court of  Justice.
            - The jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice is general  and thereby differs from that of specialist international tribunals,  such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS).
            - The Court is not a Supreme Court to which national courts can turn;  it does not act as a court of last resort for individuals. Nor is it an  appeal court for any international tribunal. It can, however, rule on  the validity of arbitral awards.
            - The Court can only hear a dispute when requested to do so by one or  more States. It cannot deal with a dispute on its own initiative.  Neither is it permitted, under its Statute, to investigate and rule on  acts of sovereign States as it chooses.
            - The ICJ only has jurisdiction based on consent, not compulsory jurisdiction.
            - It does not enjoy a full separation of powers, with permanent  members of the Security Council being able to veto enforcement of cases,  even those to which they consented to be bound.
            - 
        - Way Forward
        - 
            - The International Court of Justice is endowed with both a privileged  institutional status and procedural instruments whose potential is  frequently underestimated.
            - The International Court of Justice is a component, not only of the  machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes created by the Charter  but also of the general system for the maintenance of international  peace and security it established.
            - The Court’s contribution to the institutional law of the United  Nations was threefold. Its jurisprudence had helped to consolidate the  Organization’s role and place in the international legal order by  clarifying its legal status as an international organization and the  scope of powers with which it was entrusted.
            - Its decisions had also shed light, within the institution itself, on  the functioning and responsibilities of the Organization’s principal  organs and on those functions’ limits.
            - Moreover, the Court had pronounced itself in texts adopted by the  General Assembly, thereby strengthening the cooperation in the promotion  and development of international peace.
            - Recently, the Court had the opportunity to reiterate that finding in its opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which had been delivered in 2004.
            - The Court had recalled that, although the Security Council had  primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and  security under Article 24 of the Charter, its responsibility was not  exclusive.
            - Turning to "Crimes against humanity", while the Rome Statute  regulated "vertical relationships" between the International Criminal  Court and its States Parties, it did not prescribe any obligations  regarding adoption of national laws on such crimes or inter-State  cooperation.
            - The current work would create "horizontal relationships" among  States and regulate inter-State cooperation, strengthening the  international community’s efforts to prevent those crimes.
