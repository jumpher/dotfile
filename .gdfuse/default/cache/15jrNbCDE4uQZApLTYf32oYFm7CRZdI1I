During their exile in the forest, the [Pandava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandava)   princes were famished due to the lack of food, and their wife Draupadi  was pained by this because she could not extend the customary  hospitality to their guests. [Yudhishthira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira) , who was the eldest, prayed to Lord [Surya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya) ,  who gave him this bowl, which would remain full till Draupadi served  all of their guests. During Sage Durvasa's visit, Lord Krishna made this  bowl invincible for Draupadi so that the magical bowl called  __ Akshaya Patra __   would always remain full with food of their choice, even as to satiate the whole universe if required.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akshaya_Tritiya#cite_note-12)
