- **#Crocodiles and Alligators and Gharials**
    - the term ‘Crocodilians’ which includes  three families – the Crocodylidae, Alligatoridae (alligators) and  Gavialidae, i.e. the gharials. We don’t have alligators in India.
    - We do have three kinds of crocodiles in  India - the mugger crocodile is the most common, followed by the  saltwater crocodile (both species are commonly referred to as  “crocodiles”) and the gharials.
    - #################Jaw###############
    - This is  the most visually distinguishable factor. Crocodiles have broad and  wide jaws. They can open their jaws fully and they have powerful teeth  that enable them to prey on large animals. When their jaw is closed,  crocodiles often look like they are grinning!
    - Gharials  have long and slender jaws. Their jaws don’t open all the way and so  they prey on smaller animals. Their jaws are weak in comparison to the  jaws of the crocodile; however, they do have razor-sharp teeth - a 110  of them! Crocodiles have much fewer teeth in comparison.
    - Habitat:
    - Crocodiles  are found in North America, Africa, Asia and Australia. In India,  mugger crocodiles are found in almost all parts India while the  saltwater crocodiles dwell in the eastern side of the country.  Crocodiles inhabit both fresh and saltwater habitats.
    - Gharials  - the rarest amongst the three are only found in India, Bangladesh,  Pakistan and some other neighbouring countries. In India, they are found  only in some rivers - the Chambal, the Ganga, Yamuna, Kali, Kosi and  Gandak.
    - Locomotion on land and in water:
    - Crocodiles  can walk on land using their limbs. Gharials use their belly to slide  on land and are much slower than crocodiles. However, in water bodies,  the gharials are swift swimmers, much faster than crocodiles.
    - Other physical differences:
    - Gharials  are bigger than freshwater crocodiles but smaller than saltwater crocs.  Besides, their snout makes them much longer as well. Gharials,  especially the females, have a bulbous structure at the tip of its nose.  This structure is absent in crocodiles.
    - Having  stated the difference between the two, it is also worth taking note of  the fact that gharials were once thought to be getting extinct. However,  their recent spottings are making
    - wildlife experts contemplate whether  the species is having a possible comeback.

- **Cheeta and Leopard and Jaguar**
    - Cheetah
        - Firstly,  the cheetah is not really a true “big cat.” If you thought I would  include it after reading the title, then you’ve failed the first test.  But not really, because I am including it. Well done, you haven’t failed. Yet.
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8529f5325c6275ac30b4187d62f12a8c)
    - Secondly, this is not a cheetah; it’s a leopard. Expect the unexpected.
        - This is a cheetah:
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-031ee18da5411c5968aca2a73ccc2742)
        - Tall but relatively slender body.
        - Solid black spots (easiest way to tell).
        - Black “tear marks” stretching from the corner of the eye, down the cheek.
        - Claws are non-retractable and always visible (might not want to get too close to check this out, though.)
        - Reasonably conflict-averse when it comes to humans; will probably walk away. Stay tall and don’t run if you see one.
    - Leopard
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0bf95abdff47328348a24663f66b2eb1)
    - Come on; this guy doesn’t really look anything like a cheetah, does he?
        - Mainly  “rosettes” instead of solid black spots (sort of incomplete circly  things — scientific definition). The head and ends of the limbs seem to  have tighter circles/black spots though.
        - More stocky, muscular body than a cheetah. (All but the smallest leopards are generally quite a bit heavier.)
        - Don’t look it in the eye—it’ll take it as a challenge, and shank you.
    - Jaguar
        - OK, this one’s a bit trickier.
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ca5de9a2d80e97ff29ceeebec18f3cd9)
        - Even stockier and more muscular than the leopard. (As for the cheetah? Fuhgeddaboudit.)
        - Generally has a shorter tail than the leopard and cheetah.
        - Broader head with more of a “squashed” look to it. (Reminds me of a pitbull or staffie.)
        - Larger rosettes, often with spots in the middle.
        - Adept  swimmer—if you’re paddling through the Pantanal and get attacked by a  big cat, you know it’s a jaguar. (Also because it’s the only big cat  that lives there.)
        - Often  kills prey with a bite through the skull, unlike leopards and cheetahs.  If it’s bitten through your skull, you know you’ve just been killed by a  jaguar.
        - Probably  won’t kill you though; it’s pretty shy and elusive. If you don’t see  anything, it’s probably a jaguar. But sometimes when you don’t see  anything, it’s because it’s nothing.
    - Pattern Recognition
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec6d4a93aadc33f48fc5521ddc980f38)
    - Have you learned anything? Correctly identify A, B, and C to win absolutely nothing.
        - (A: Leopard, B: Cheetah, C: Jaguar)
        - D: Lion

    - Woof.
        - Hard Mode — “Black Panther”
        - Black  panthers are not separate species. They’re simply “melanistic” colour  variants of either leopards or jaguars. They usually have a faint  pattern visible, but it’s pretty hard to make it out.
        - Jaguar or leopard?
    - ![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ae71130feabb111fa02c7dfb63a1882d)
    - How about this one?

    - Place your bets, aaaaandddd:
        - 1st pic is a jaguar, 2nd is a leopard. You can mostly tell by the jaguar’s big ol’ fat head.
        - And there ends today’s lesson
