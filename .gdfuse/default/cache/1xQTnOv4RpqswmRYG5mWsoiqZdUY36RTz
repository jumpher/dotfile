- The **Battle of Koregaon**  (also called the Battle of Koregaon Bhima) was fought on 1 January 1818 between the [British East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company)  and the [Peshwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshwa)  faction of the [Maratha Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Confederacy) , at [Koregaon Bhima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koregaon_Bhima) .
    - A 28,000-strong force led by Peshwa [Baji Rao II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baji_Rao_II) whilst on their way to attack the company-held [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), were unexpectedly met by an 800-strong Company force that was on its way to reinforce the British troops in Pune. The Peshwa dispatched around 2,000 soldiers to attack the force which sought entrenchment in Koregaon. Led by Captain Francis Staunton, the Company troops defended their position for nearly 12 hours, before the Peshwa's troops ultimately withdrew, fearing the imminent arrival of a larger British force.
    - The battle was part of the [Third Anglo Maratha war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Maratha_War), a series of battles that culminated in the defeat of the Peshwa rule and subsequent rule of the British East India Company in nearly all of Western, Central and Southern India.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-2) There is a "victory pillar" ([obelisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk)) in Koregaon commemorating the battle.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-3)
    - When Elphinstone visited the battle field shortly after its completion, he found that the Company soldiers had completely lost their morale and were reluctant to believe the praises that were showered on them .[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-20)
    - General Smith arrived in Koregaon on 3 January, but by this time, the Peshwa had already left the area.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-HTP_1825-11) A company force led by General Pritzler pursued Peshwa, who tried to escape to [Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_State). Meanwhile, General Smith captured [Satara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satara_(city)), the capital of Pratap Singh. Smith intercepted Peshwa in a battle on 19 February 1818 at Ashtoon (or Ashta); Bapuji Gokhale was killed in this action. The Peshwa then fled to [Khandesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khandesh), while his [jagirdars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagirdar) accepted the Company's suzerainty. A dejected Peshwa then met with [John Malcolm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malcolm) on 2 June 1818, and surrendered his royal claims in exchange for a pension and a residence in [Bithoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bithoor). Trimbakji Dengle was captured near Nashik and imprisoned at the [Chunar Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunar_Fort).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-Peter_1837-9)
    - As a reward for their bravery in the Battle of Koregaon, the 2nd battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry was made [Grenadiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadier). Their regiment came to be known as [1st Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/102nd_Prince_of_Wales%27s_Own_Grenadiers).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-Gazetteer1885-1) The official report to the British Residents at Poona recalls the "heroic valour and enduring fortitude" of the soldiers, the "disciplined intrepidity" and "devoted courage and admirable consistency" of their actions.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-EPW-21)
    - Captain Staunton was appointed an honorary [aide-de-camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp) to the [Governor General of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_India). The [Court of Directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_East_India_Company_directors) presented him with a sword and a sum of 500 [guineas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_(British_coin)) (gold coins). Later in 1823, he became a Major, and was appointed a companion of the [Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-Gazetteer1885-1)
    - General [Thomas Hislop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Hislop,_1st_Baronet) called the battle "one of the most heroic and brilliant achievements ever recorded on the annals of the army".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-Gazetteer1885-1) According to M.S. Naravane, "this gallant defense by a small number of Company's troops against an overwhelming Maratha force is rightly considered as one of the most glorious example of valour and fortitude in the annals of the Company's forces."[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-Naravane-22)
    - General Smith, in his official report of this battle, wrote, “The action at Koregaum was one of the most brilliant affairs achieved by any army in which European and Native soldiers displayed the most noble devotion and most romantic bravery under pressure of hunger and thirst almost beyond human endurance. [[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-23)
    - Neither side achieved a decisive victory in the battle.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShraddha_Kumbhojkar201540-24)  Shortly after the battle, [Mountstuart Elphinstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountstuart_Elphinstone)  described it as a "small victory" for the Peshwa.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-25)  Nevertheless, the East India Company government praised the bravery of its troops, who could not be overpowered despite being outnumbered.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShraddha_Kumbhojkar201540-24)
    - Notwithstanding this, the battle being one of the last ones to be fought in the [Third Anglo-Maratha War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Maratha_War), is since recognised as a Company victory after the war ended with Peshwa's defeat.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Koregaon#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShraddha_Kumbhojkar201540-24)

- Battle of Tarains
    - First Battle of Tarain
        - The first battle of Tarain was fought  in 1191 between the Ghurids, a Turkish tribe, led by Muhammad Ghori and  the Rajputs led by Prithviraj Chauhan and his allies. The resulting  engagement ended in victory for the Rajput forces.

        - Background of the Battle of Tarain
        - Following the decline of the  Ghaznavid empire in the 12th century led to a power vacuum in which  various tribes fought for control of the empire. Among these, the  Ghurids emerged victoriously and managed to sack the erstwhile city of  Ghazni by 1149. The Ghurid empire would be led by two brothers Muhammad  Ghori (known as Mu’izz al-Din) and Ghiyas al-Din who embarked in an  expansion policy which would encompass most of modern-day Afghanistan,  Iran and Pakistan.

        - Soon they looked towards expanding  their empire east into India. At the time northern India was a  collection of loose-states. Of the most powerful ones were the [Chalukya dynasty](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/ncert-notes-chalukya-dynasty/)  in Gujarat, the Solanki dynasty of Jaichandra in Kanauj and the Rajput  Chahamanas of Prithviraj Chauhan based out of Ajmer and Delhi. Muhammed  Ghori sent an envoy to the court of Prithvi Raj Chauhan first to come to  a settlement. The terms included conversion to Islam and accepting the  suzerainty of the Ghurids. Prithvi Raj Chauhan refused.
        - The first battle of Tarain was one of many battles fought during the [Arab and Turkish invasions of India](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/arab-and-turkish-invasions/). To know more about these invasions follow the linked article.
        - Undeterred, Muhammad Ghuri marched  his army to the kingdom of the Chalukyas in 1178. He did this as the  direct route to Delhi was blocked by the last remnants of the Ghaznavids  located in Lahore and Multan. The Ghurid army was defeated by the  Chalukya army and forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties.  Still not to be deterred by setbacks, Muhammad Ghori built up his forces  and defeated the last remnants of the Ghaznavids when he took Lahore in  1186. Now the route lay open for Muhammad Ghori to attack Prithvi Raj  Chauhan’s kingdom.

        - Events during the First Battle of Tarain
        - Marching his forces into India,  Muhammad Ghori proceeded to capture the important fort of Bathinda. The  fall of Bathinda galvanised the Delhi forces into action. Prithviraj  Chauhan’s gathered his allies and led his army to face Muhammad Ghori in  battle.
        - The two armies faced each other on  the fields of Tarain, 150 kilometres north of Delhi in 1191. Although  contemporary sources placed Prithviraj Chauhan’s army at 200,000 in  numbers, modern historians agree that it numbered at 50,000. Similarly,  the size of the Ghurid forces was though to be numbered at 100,000 but  historians believed it was marginally smaller than Prithvi Raj Chauhan’s  forces.
        - The Ghurid army had an advantage in  cavalry archers famed whose famed mobility put the mainly infantry  Rajput forces at a disadvantage. But the Rajputs had strength in numbers  and elephants
        - The battle began with a probing  attack by the Ghurid archers who peppered the Rajput formation with  arrows. Prithvi Raj Chauhan responded immediately with an all-out attack  which surprised the Ghurids. They were unused to the Rajput way of  fighting which favoured close combat fighting. The Rajputs pursued the  retreating horse archers and covered much ground until they were upon  the main Ghurid army. To their credit, the Ghurid army held firm their  ground resisting waves of infantry but the Rajput cavalry began to  overwhelm the Ghurid flank.
        - It became clear to Muhammad Ghori  that the close-quarter fighting favoured the Rajputs immensely. Unable  to withstand the pressure on their flank, Muhammad’s troops broke ranks  and fled. Meanwhile, in the Ghurid centre, Rajput elephants put pressure  on the remaining troops and they began to waver.
        - ** First Battle of Tarrain – UPSC Notes:-**
        - Attempting  the salvage a desperate situation, Muhammad Ghori charged into the fray  hoping to rally his troops. He came upon the commander of the Rajput  forces, Govind Rai. Hurling his spear at Govind Rai, the projectile was  blocked and in turn, Govind Rai hurled his own spear at Muhammad Ghori,  its impact knocking him almost unconscious. His life was saved by his  bodyguard who spirited him away from the battlefield. Seeing their  commander retreating from the field, the morale of the Ghurids was  further broken and they ran away from the field. The Rajput army pursued  the Ghurids for almost 40 kilometres before Prithviraj Chauhan turned  his attention toward laying siege to the fort at Bathinda, which fell in  1192.
        - The aftermath of the first battle of Tarain
            - Prithvi Raj Chauhan’s inability to  pursue and annihilate his foe and consolidate his borders would have  detrimental effects in Indian history as the second battle of Tarain  would prove.
            - This would not be the end of Ghurid  incursions into India as Muhammad Ghori would return, having learnt his  enemies strength and weaknesses and mindful of not to underestimate his  opponents in battle.
    - Second Battle of Tarain
        - The second battle of Tarain was  fought between the Ghurid army led by Muhammad Ghori and the Rajput  Chahamanas and their allies led by Prithvi Raj Chauhan in 1192. The  battle saw the defeat of the Rajputs, opening north India to future  invasions and domination by Turkic tribes.
        - This article will give further details about the second battle of Tarain within the context of the[IAS Exam](https://byjus.com/ias-exam/).
        - Background of the second battle of Tarain
        - Following his defeat at the hands of Prithvi Raj Chauhan during the [first battle of Tarain](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/first-battle-of-tarain-1191/)  in 1191, Muhammad Ghori returned to Ghazni. He publicly shamed and  dismissed the captains and commanders of his forces who showed cowardice  at Tarain and took a vow to forego all luxuries until he avenged his  defeat. Keeping this in mind he set about rebuilding his forces putting  greater emphasis on firepower, mobility and discipline.
        - Prithvi Raj Chuhan meanwhile was  elated at his victory at Tarain. Convinced that he had demonstrated the  superiority of his forces, he neglected to strengthen his borders,  although he did send proposals to neighbouring kingdoms in order to  field a larger army should the Ghurids make a renewed attempt.
        - In the summer of 1192, Muhammad Ghori  marched with an army of 52,000 cavalries, nearly half of the army of  the Ghurid Army. When he reached Peshawar he decided it would be prudent  to forgive his dismissed commanders and implored them to rejoin his  army which they did.

        - Muhammad Ghori recaptured the fort at  Bathinda when barely a month had passed since it fell to the Rajput  forces. Once again Muhammad Ghori sent a demand to Prithvi Raj Chauhan  to accept him as suzerain and just like last time it was refused.  Prithvi Raj Chauhan marched out to meet Muhammad Ghori once again but  the number of men he had raised for his army was below his expectation  as he had sent his commanders campaigning elsewhere in the previous  months.
        - Although contemporary sources  exaggerate Prithvi Raj Chauhans’ forces numbered 500,000 men and 3000  elephants, modern historians believed that 100,000 was the correct  number with 300 elephants.
        - Facing each other once more on the  fields of Tarain, Prithvi Raj Chauhan sent a message to Muhammad Ghori  that he was willing to let the Ghurid king return to his homeland  without a fight but should he continue his endeavour, he would destroy  him. Utilising the concept of war as a deception, he pretended to agree  to his terms, demanding that he retain Bathinda and Multan while seeking  time to consult with his brother who was co-ruler. Meanwhile, the  Ghurid forces made preparations and carried out reconnaissance of the  Rajput forces.

        - The ruse lured Prithivi Raj into a  false sense of security in which he neglected to carry out scouting  mission of his own. The Ghurid army marched out at the crack of dawn,  carrying out a surprise raid in the Rajput camp in which several war  elephants were neutralised.
        - Unused to such a kind of warfare as  their military ethos forbade night-time battles, the Rajputs took time  in recovering from their initial surprise until eventually repulsing the  Ghurid cavalry attacking them. In their pursuit of the raiding force,  the Rajputs found that the Ghurids had already arrayed themselves in  battle formation. The second battle of Tarain was about to begin.
        - ** Second Battle of Tarain – UPSC Notes:-**
    - Events during the second battle of Tarain
        - Knowing the Rajput forces were  well-disciplined, the Ghurids did not want to engage in melee combat  with them. Instead, the Ghurids army was formed into five units, and  four units were sent to attack the enemy flanks and rear.
        - As per historical sources, Muhammad  Ghori directed a light cavalry force of 10,000 mounted archers, divided  into four divisions, to surround the Rajput forces on the four sides. He  instructed these soldiers not to engage in combat when the enemy  advanced to attack, and instead feigned a retreat in order to exhaust  the Rajput elephants, horses, and infantry.
        - Ghori changed his tactics, he employed a tactic that had been the  mainstay of horse archers for centuries – a feigned retreat. As expected  the Rajput forces charged the supposedly retreating unit. The  remaining Ghurid forces then attacked and some of the Rajput troops  fled in panic, while others stood their ground and fought to the last  breath. The Ghurid forces had emerged victorious and Muhammad Ghori had  avenged his defeat from the battle a year earlier.

        - The aftermath of the second battle of Tarain
            - As per various historical sources, it  is stated that Prithvi Raj Chauhan was captured and summarily executed  while other medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to capital  at Ajmer, where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid vassal.  Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad and was killed for  ‘treason’.
            - Whatever Prithviraj’s Chauhan fate,  his kingdom fell to the Ghurid forces with relative ease eventually  subjugating the entire Gangetic plain in less than a decade and reaching  as far as Bengal.
            - The second battle of Tarain is significant among the[Turkish and Arab invasions of India](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/arab-and-turkish-invasions/)  in the sense that though the Ghurid Kingdom would not last, the Islamic  presence that it had brought in its wake enured that it would have a  permanent base, influencing the cultural dynamics and history of the  Indian subcontinent from that point on.

- Battle of Panipats
    - First Battle of Panipat (1526)
        - The Battle
            - The First Battle of Panipat (21 April 1526) fought near a small  village of Panipat( Haryana), this marked the beginning of Mughal Empire  in India.
            - The battle was fought between the invading forces of Zahir-ud-din Babur and the last empire of the Delhi Sultanate, Lodi Empire during the rule of Ibrahim Lodi.
        - The Military Force
            - Babur’s forces numbered around 15,000 men with 20 to 24 pieces of field artillery.
            - The fighting force of Ibrahim Lodi was around 30,000 to 40,000 men in total, along with at least 1000 war elephants.
            - Babur’s army used guns which proved to be decisive in the battlefield but the Sultan lacked any field artillery.
            - Moreover, the sound of the cannons used by Babur’s army frightened Lodi’s elephants, causing them to trample Lodi’s own men.
        - Babur’s Tactics
            - The weapons were not all, it was Babur’s tactics of Tulughma and Araba that led him to victory.
            - Araba: the centre forward division was then  provided with carts (araba) which were placed in rows facing the enemy  and tied to each other with animal hide ropes.
            - Tulughma: it meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre.
            - Through this a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all the sides.
            - The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions.
            - Behind the Araba, cannons were placed which could be fired without  any fear of being hit as they were shielded by the bullock carts which  were held in place due to the hide ropes holding them together.
        - Result
            - The Mughal forces of Babur, the Timurid ruler of Kabulistan,  defeated the much larger ruling army of Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi.
            - The victory enabled Babur to lay the foundations for the Indian Mughal Empire.
            - Ibrahim Lodi died on the field of battle, abandoned by his feudatories and generals (many of whom were mercenaries).
            - Most of them changed their allegiance to the new master of Delhi.
            - However, the fate could have been turned in the favour of Sultan  Ibrahim if he had survived another hour of fighting as Babur had no  reserves left and his troops were rapidly tiring.
        - Note: This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery.

            - Militarily, the battle pitted the French-supplied artillery and  cavalry of the Marathas against the heavy cavalry and mounted  artillery(zamburak and jezail) of the Afghans and Rohillas led by Ahmad  Shah Durrani and Najib-ud-Daulah.
            - Ahmad Shah Durrani was also known as Ahmad Shah Abdali.
            - The battle is considered one of the largest fought in the 18th  century with the largest number of fatalities in a single day reported  in a classic formation battle between two armies.
        - Background
            - The decline of the Mughal Empire following the 27-year  Mughal-Maratha war (1680–1707) had led to rapid territorial gains for  the Maratha Empire.
            - Under Peshwa Baji Rao, Gujarat and Malwa came under Maratha control.
            - Finally, in 1737, Baji Rao defeated the Mughals on the outskirts of  Delhi, and brought much of the former Mughal territories south of Delhi  under Maratha control.
            - This brought the Marathas into direct confrontation with the Durrani empire of Ahmad Shah Abdali.
            - In 1759, he raised an army from the Pashtun tribes and made several gains against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Punjab.
            - He then joined with his Indian allies - the Rohilla Afghans of the  Gangetic Doab - forming a broad coalition against the Marathas.
        - Role of Shuja-ud-Daulah
            - Both the Marathas as well as Afghans tried to get the Nawab of Awadh, Shuja-ud-Daulah, into their camp.
            - By late July, Shuja-ud-Daulah made the decision to join the  Afghan-Rohilla coalition, preferring to join what was perceived as the  ‘army of Islam’.
            - This was strategically a major loss for the Marathas, since Shuja  provided much needed finances for the long Afghan stay in North India.
            - It is doubtful whether the Afghan-Rohilla coalition would have the  means to continue their conflict with the Marathas without Shuja’s  support.
        - Cutting off the Supplies
            - In August, 1760, the Maratha camp finally reached Delhi and took the city.
            - There followed a series of skirmishes along the banks of the river  Yamuna, and a battle at Kunjpura, which the Marathas won against an  Afghan garrison of about 15,000.
            - However, Abdali daringly crossed the river Yamuna in October at Baghpat, cutting off the Maratha camp from their base in Delhi.
            - During the siege both sides tried to cut off the other’s supplies at  which the Afghans were considerably more effective; by the end of  November 1760 they had cut off almost all food supplies into the  besieged Maratha camp.
            - This eventually turned into a two-month-long siege led by Abdali against the Marathas in the town of Panipat.
            - The food in the Maratha camp ran out by late December or early January and cattle died by the thousands.
            - Reports of soldiers dying of starvation began to be heard in early January.
        - The Battle
        - With no supplies and dying soldiers, the Maratha chiefs begged their  commander, Sadashiv Rao Bhau, to be allowed to die in battle than  perish by starvation.
        - In a desperate attempt to break the siege, the Marathas left their camp to march towards the Afghan camp.
        - The battle lasted for several days and involved over 125,000 troops.
        - Protracted skirmishes occurred, with losses and gains on both sides.
        - The forces led by Ahmad Shah Durrani came out victorious after destroying several Maratha flanks.
        - The extent of the losses on both sides is believed that:
        - the numbers of injured and prisoners taken vary considerably. about  40,000 Maratha prisoners were slaughtered in cold blood the day after  the battle.
        - between 60,000–70,000 were killed in fighting
        - Result
            - The result of the battle was the halting of further Maratha advances  in the north, and a destabilization of their territories, for roughly  10 years.
            - This period of 10 years is marked by the rule of Peshwa Madhavrao,  who is credited with the revival of Maratha domination following the  defeat at Panipat.
            - In 1771, 10 years after Panipat, Peshwa Madhavrao sent a large  Maratha army into North India in an expedition that was meant to:
            - Punish refractory powers that had either sided with the Afghans,  such as the Rohillas, or had shaken off Maratha domination after  Panipat.
            - Re-establish the Maratha domination in North India
            - The success of this campaign can be seen as the last saga of the long story of Panipat.
