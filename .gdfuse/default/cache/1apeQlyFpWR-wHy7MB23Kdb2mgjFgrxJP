- Gender Parity Index
    - The  Gender Parity Index is a socioeconomic index usually designed to  measure the relative access to education of males and females. This  index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as  the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in  a given stage of education.

            - 
- CAMPA Act:
    - To  compensate the loss of forest area and to maintain the sustainability,  the Government of India came up with a well-defined Act, known as CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority).
    - The law establishes the National Compensatory Afforestation Fund under the Public Account of India, and a State Compensatory Afforestation Fund under the Public Account of each state.
    - These Funds will receive payments for: (i) compensatory afforestation, (ii) net present value of forest (NPV), and (iii) other project specific payments.
    - The National Fund will receive 10% of these funds, and the State Funds will receive the remaining 90%.
    - According to the Act’s provision, a company diverting forest land must provide alternative land to take up compensatory afforestation.
    - For afforestation, the company should pay to plant new trees in the alternative land provided to the state.
    - Issues with CAMPA:
        - In 2002, the Supreme Court had observed that collected funds for afforestation were under-utilised by the states and it ordered for centrally pooling of funds under ad hoc Compensatory Afforestation Fund.
        - The law says that land selected for afforestation should preferably be contiguous to the forest being diverted  so that it is easier for forest officials to manage it. But if no  suitable non-forest land is found, degraded forests can be chosen for  afforestation. In several states like Chattisgarh, Odisha and Jharkhand  where the intensity of mining is very high, to find the non-forest land for afforestation to compensate the loss of forest is a big task.
        - Utilisation of CAMPA fund:  Several state governments are not utilising it properly. An amount of  Rs 86 lakh from CAMPA funds meant for afforestation was reportedly spent  on litigation work in Punjab.
        - Moreover,  at several places, the loss of natural species is compensated with  plantation of non-native species in the name of the artificial  plantation. It serves as a threat to even the existing ecosystem.
        - Way ahead:
            - The  proposed objective of the Act must be fulfilled by utilising the CAMPA  funds only for the purpose it is meant for. It should efficiently be  used only for afforestation and wildlife conservation activities.
            - A  closer look at the state government activities using CAMPA funding is  needed. The central government should adopt the concept of outcome  budgeting for allocation of funds to the state government in which  funding will be done on installment basis by checking the outcome of  previous funds.
            - State governments should restore the existing forests rather than creating new ones.

- PDS
    - Introduction
        - The Public distribution system (PDS) is an Indian food Security System established under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution.
        - PDS evolved as a system of management of scarcity through distribution of food grains at affordable prices.
        - PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State Governments.
            - The Central Government, through Food Corporation of  India (FCI), has assumed the responsibility for procurement, storage,  transportation and bulk allocation of food grains to the State  Governments.
            - The operational responsibilities including allocation within the  State, identification of eligible families, issue of Ration Cards and  supervision of the functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) etc., rest  with the State Governments.
            - Under the PDS, presently the commodities namely wheat, rice, sugar and kerosene  are being allocated to the States/UTs for distribution. Some States/UTs  also distribute additional items of mass consumption through the PDS  outlets such as pulses, edible oils, iodized salt, spices, etc.
        - 
        - Evolution of PDS in India
            - PDS was introduced around World War II as a war-time rationing measure. Before the 1960s, distribution through PDS was generally dependant on imports of food grains.
            - It was expanded in the 1960s as a response to the food shortages of the time; subsequently, the government set up the Agriculture Prices Commission and the FCI to improve domestic procurement and storage of food grains for PDS.
            - By the 1970s, PDS had evolved into a universal scheme for the distribution of subsidised food
            - Till 1992, PDS was a general entitlement scheme for all consumers without any specific target.
            - The Revamped Public Distribution System (RPDS) was  launched in June, 1992 with a view to strengthen and streamline the PDS  as well as to improve its reach in the far-flung, hilly, remote and  inaccessible areas where a substantial section of the underprivileged  classes lives.
            - In June, 1997, the Government of India launched the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) with a focus on the poor.
            - Under TPDS, beneficiaries were divided into two categories: Households below the poverty line or BPL; and Households above the poverty line or APL.
        - Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY): AAY was a step in the direction of making TPDS aim at reducing hunger among the poorest segments of the BPL population.
            - A National Sample Survey exercise pointed towards the fact that  about 5% of the total population in the country sleeps without two  square meals a day. In order to make TPDS more focused and targeted  towards this category of population, the "Antyodaya Anna Yojana” (AAY)  was launched in December, 2000 for one crore poorest of the poor families.
            - In September 2013, Parliament enacted the National Food Security Act, 2013.  The Act relies largely on the existing TPDS to deliver food grains as  legal entitlements to poor households. This marks a shift by making the right to food a justiciable right.
        - 
        - How PDS system functions?
            - The Central and State Governments share responsibilities in order to provide food grains to the identified beneficiaries.
            - The centre procures food grains from farmers at a minimum support price (MSP) and sells it to states at central issue prices. It is responsible for transporting the grains to godowns in each state.
            - States bear the responsibility of transporting food grains from these godowns to each fair price shop (ration shop), where the beneficiary buys the food grains at the lower central issue price. Many states further subsidise the price of food grains before selling it to beneficiaries.
    - Importance of PDS
        - It helps in ensuring Food and Nutritional Security of the nation.
            - 
            - It has helped in stabilising food prices and making food available to the poor at affordable prices.
            - 
            - It maintains the buffer stock of food grains in the warehouse so that the flow of food remain active even during the period of less agricultural food production.
            - 
            - It has helped in redistribution of grains by supplying food from surplus regions of the country to deficient regions.
            - 
            - The system of minimum support price and procurement has contributed to the increase in food grain production.
            - 
            - Issues Associated with PDS System in India
            - Identification of beneficiaries: Studies have shown that targeting mechanisms such as TPDS are prone to large inclusion and exclusion errors.  This implies that entitled beneficiaries are not getting food grains  while those that are ineligible are getting undue benefits.
            - According to the estimation of an expert group set up in 2009, PDS  suffers from nearly 61% error of exclusion and 25% inclusion of  beneficiaries, i.e. the misclassification of the poor as non-poor and  vice versa.
            - Leakage of food grains: (Transportation leakages +  Black Marketing by FPS owners) TPDS suffers from large leakages of food  grains during transportation to and from ration shops into the open  market. In an evaluation of TPDS, the erstwhile Planning Commission  found 36% leakage of PDS rice and wheat at the all-India level.
            - Issue with procurement: Open-ended Procurement  i.e., all incoming grains accepted even if buffer stock is filled,  creates a shortage in the open market.
            - Issues with storage: A performance audit by the CAG has revealed a serious shortfall in the government’s storage capacity.
            - Given the increasing procurement and incidents of rotting food grains, the lack of adequate covered storage is bound to be a cause for concern.
            - The provision of minimum support price (MSP) has  encouraged farmers to divert land from production of coarse grains that  are consumed by the poor, to rice and wheat and thus, discourages crop diversification.
            - Environmental issues: The over-emphasis on attaining self-sufficiency and a surplus in food grains, which are water-intensive, has been found to be environmentally unsustainable.
            - It was found that due to cultivation of rice in north-west India, the water table went down by 33 cm per year during 2002-08.
            - Procuring states such as Punjab and Haryana are under environmental stress, including rapid groundwater depletion, deteriorating soil and water conditions from overuse of fertilisers.
            - 
            - PDS Reforms
                - Role of Aadhar: Integrating Aadhar with TPDS will help in better identification of beneficiaries and address the problem of inclusion and exclusion errors.  According to a study by the Unique Identification Authority of India,  using Aadhaar with TPDS would help eliminate duplicate and ghost (fake)  beneficiaries, and make identification of beneficiaries more accurate.
                - Technology-based reforms of TPDS implemented by states: Wadhwa Committee,  appointed by the Supreme court, found that certain states had  implemented computerisation and other technology-based reforms to TPDS.  Technology-based reforms helped plug leakages of food grains during  TPDS.
                    - Tamil Nadu implements a universal PDS, such that every household is entitled to subsidised food grains.
                    - States such as Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have implemented IT  measures to streamline TPDS, through the digitisation of ration cards,  the use of GPS tracking of delivery, and the use of SMS based monitoring  by citizens.
                - Technology-based reforms to TPDS undertaken by some states
            - Type of reform
                - Benefits of reform
                - States implementing reforms
            - Digitisation of ration cards
                - Allows for online entry and verification of beneficiary data
                - Online storing of monthly entitlement of beneficiaries, number of  dependants, offtake of food grains by beneficiaries from FPS, etc
                - Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, etc.
            - Computerised allocation to FPS
                - Computerises FPS allocation, declaration of stock balance, web-based truck challans, etc.
                - Allows for quick and efficient tracking of transactions
                - Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, etc.
            - Issue of smart cards in place of ration cards
                - Secure electronic devices used to store beneficiary data
                - Stores data such as name, address, biometrics, BPL/APL category and monthly entitlement of beneficiaries and family members
                - Prevents counterfeiting
                - Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha etc.
            - Use of GPS technology
                - Use of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to track movement of trucks carrying food grains from state depots to FPS
                - Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu
            - SMS based monitoring
                - Allows monitoring by citizens so they can register their mobile  numbers and send/receive SMS slerts during dispatch and arrival of TPDS  commodities
                - Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu
            - Use of web-based citizens' portal
                - Publicises grievance redressal machinery, such as toll free number for call centres to register complaints or suggestions

            - 
            - PDS vs. Cash Transfers
                - National Food Security Act,2013 provides for reforms in the TPDS  including schemes such as Cash transfers for provisioning of food  entitlements.
                - Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) aims to:
                    - reduce the need for huge physical movement of foodgrains
                    - provide greater autonomy to beneficiaries to choose their consumption basket
                    - enhance dietary diversity
                    - reduce leakages
                    - facilitate better targeting
                    - promote financial inclusion
            - Advantages and disadvantages of PDS and other delivery mechanisms
                - Machanism
                    - Advantages
                    - Disadvantages
                - PDS
                    - Insulates beneficiaries from inflation and price volatility
                    - Ensures entitlement is used for food grains only
                    - Well-developed network of FPS ensures access to food grains even in remote areas
                    - Low offtake of food grains from each household
                    - High leakage and diversion of subsidised food grain
                    - Adulteration of food grain
                    - Lack of viability of FPS due to low margins
                - Cash transfers
                    - Cash in the hands of poor increases their choicess
                    - Cash may relieve financial constraints faced by the poor, make it possible to form thrift societies and access credit
                    - Administrative costs of cash transfer programmes may be significantly lesser than that of other schemes
                    - Potential for making electronic transfer
                    - Cash can be used buy non-food items
                    - May expose recipients to price volatility and inflation
                    - There is poor access to banks and post offices in some areas
                - Food coupons
                    - Household is given the freedom to choose where it buys food
                    - Increases incentive for competitive prices and assured quality of food grains among PDS stores
                    - Ration shops get full food grains from the poor, no incentive to turn the poor away
                    - Food coupons are not indexed for inflation; may expose recipients to inflation
                    - Difficult to administer; there have known to be delays in issuing food coupons and reimbursing shops
            - 
            - Way Forward
                - PDS is one of the biggest welfare programmes of the government,  helping farmers sell their produce at remunerative prices as well as the  poorer sections of society to buy food grains at affordable rates.
                - Its effectiveness can be enhanced with technology based solutions as is evident from some of the states’ successes towards the same. Shifting towards DBT is another idea, but with caution.
                - Economic survey 2016-17 also highlighted the need for more caution and better infrastructure while replacing subsidised PDS supplies with DBT.
                - In its report on State finances, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has advised States that are planning to shift to cash transfer to be cautious while effecting the migration.
                - Strengthening of the existing TPDS system by capacity building and  training of the implementing authorities along with efforts to plug  leakages is the best way forward.
                - It can be further strengthened by the increased public participation through social audits and participation of SHGs, Cooperatives and NGOs in ensuring the transparency of PDS system at ground level.
                - To enhance the nutritional level of masses, bio-fortified foods need to be distributed through the PDS that will make it more relevant in the backdrop of prevalent malnutrition in India.

    - First launched in December 2018, the index has become the primary tool for monitoring progress on the SDGs in India.
    - It has also fostered competition among the states and UTs by ranking them on the global goals.
    - The index is developed in collaboration with the United Nations in India.
    - It tracks the progress of all states and UTs on 115 indicators aligned with the National Indicator Framework (NIF) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
    - How are states and UTs ranked?
    - The SDG India Index scores range between 0–100, higher the score of a State/UT, the greater the distance to target achieved.
    - States and UTs are classified in four categories based on Index score:
        - Aspirant: 0–49.
        - Performer: 50–64.
        - Front-runner: 65–99.
        - Achiever: 100.
    - Currently, there are no states in the aspirant and achiever category.
    - What are its latest findings?
        - Country’s overall SDG score improved by 6 points — from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2020-21.
        - This  improvement is on accounts of improvement in performance in providing  facilities including clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean  energy among others.
        - Kerala retained its rank as the top with a score of 75, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu both took the second spot with a score of 74.
        - Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam were the worst performing states in this year’s India index.
        - Chandigarh maintained its top spot among the UTs with a score of 79, followed by Delhi (68).

    - It prevents nature from being used as an inexhaustible source of resources and ensures its protection and rational use.
    - Aspects such as environmental conservation, investment in renewable energy, saving water, supporting sustainable mobility, and innovation in sustainable construction and architecture, contribute to achieving environmental sustainability on several fronts.
    - Social Sustainability:
        - It can foster gender equality, development of people, communities and cultures to help achieve a reasonable and fairly-distributed quality of life, healthcare and education across the Globe.
    - Economic Sustainability:
        - Focuses on equal economic growth that generates wealth for all, without harming the environment
        - Investment and equal distribution of economic resources.
        - Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions.

            - To bring sustainable development in the mainstream United Nations (UN) launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDGs.
            - This universal, integrated and transformative  agenda aims to spur actions that will end poverty and build a more  sustainable world over the next 15 years.
            - There are 17 goals and 169 targets specific targets to be achieved  by 2030. Reaching the goals requires action on all fronts – governments,  businesses, civil society and people everywhere all have a role to  play.
            - SDGs are not legally binding.
            - Roadblocks to Global Initiatives
            - To reconcile the assertion of ‘sovereignty’, by the member states  with the growing environmental interdependence and the need for  concerted action.
                - For ex: Overcoming the North-South divide is one of the major hurdles facing the international environmental protection regime.
                - The ‘North’ world has just over 20% of the world population but consumes 80% of the world’s energy; on the other hand, the ‘South’, comprising of the developing nations of the world is still struggling to provide for the basic needs for its population.
            - Methods/ways to monitor and regulate global commons (Oceans, Space  and Antarctica). Being nobody’s property may act as a disincentive for  protection.
                - Progress and Challenges Ahead
                    - Progress
                        - As per the Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2019
                            - Extreme poverty has declined considerably.
                            - The under-5 mortality rate fell by 49 % between 2000 and 2017.
                            - Immunizations have saved millions of lives.
                            - The vast majority of the world’s population now has access to electricity.
                            - Countries are taking concrete actions to protect our planet: marine protected areas have doubled since 2010.
                            - Countries are making concerted efforts to address illegal fishing.
                            - 186 parties have ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change, and almost all have communicated their first nationally determined contributions.
                            - About 150 countries have developed national policies  to respond to the challenges of rapid urbanization, and more than 70  countries and the European Union now have more than 300 policies and  instruments supporting sustainable consumption and production.
                            - A wide range of other actors—international  organizations, businesses, local authorities, the scientific community  and civil society—have engaged with the SDGs in a manner that generates  great hope for the coming decade.
                        - Challenges
                            - As per the Sustainable Development Goals Report, 2019
                                - Increasing inequality among and within countries requires urgent attention.
                                - 3 out of every 4 stunted children live in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
                                - Young people are more likely to be unemployed than adults.
                                - Barriers in achieving gender equality.
                                - Global hunger has been on the rise after a prolonged decline.
                                - Extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 8.6%  in 2018, but the pace of poverty reduction is starting to decelerate as  the world struggles to respond to entrenched deprivation, violent  conflicts and vulnerabilities to natural disasters.
                                - Extreme poverty is three times higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
                                - 2018 was the fourth warmest year on record. Levels of CO2 concentrations continued to increase in 2018.
                                - Natural environment is deteriorating at an alarming rate.
                                - Sea levels are rising.
                                - Ocean acidification is accelerating. Ocean acidity is 26% higher than in pre-industrial times.
                                - 1 million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction.
                                - Land degradation continues unchecked.
                            - Various methodologies have been evolved to monitor the progress of SDGs.
                                - Sustainable Development Index (SDI), 2019
                                    - It is released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).
                                    - The SDI seeks to help countries identify gaps that must be closed in  order to achieve SDGs by 2030 and to identify priorities for early  action.
                                    - India ranked 115 out of 162 countries.
                                - Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), 2019
                                    - It is the first GSDR prepared by the United Nations. It is entitled “The Future is Now: Science for Achieving Sustainable Development”.
                                    - It evaluated progress on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
                                    - The report finds that the current development model is not sustainable, and the progress made is in danger of being reversed through worsening social inequalities and potentially irreversible declines in the natural environment that sustains us.
                                    - The amount of modern renewable energy in the total  global energy supply has increased by an average of approx. 5% annually  over the past decade. Meanwhile, since 2009 the price of renewable electricity (solar and wind) has dropped for five years in a row.
                                    - Way Forward
                                        - To make the process of sustainable development feasible and operational, it is important to establish a common focus that can integrate the outlook and efforts of various participants in development,  worldwide, realising the diversity, in terms of geography, society,  economics, level of science and technology capabilities and capacities  and education standards/levels.
                                        - Developed countries need to change their production and consumption patterns,  including by limiting the use of fossil fuels and plastics, and to  encourage public and private investments that align with the SDGs.
                                        - Environmental commons—such as the atmosphere,  rainforests and oceans—must be safeguarded as crucial sources of  ecosystem services and natural resources. All stakeholders must work  together to conserve, restore and sustainably use natural resources.
                                        - The food system must undergo widespread changes to the  infrastructure, cultural and societal norms, and policies that are  supporting the current, unsustainable, status quo.
                                        - The much deeper, faster and more ambitious response is needed to  unleash the social and economic transformation needed to achieve our  2030 goals.
                                        - A far more optimistic future is still attainable only by drastically changing development policies, incentives and actions.
- **Satyam**
    - Why in News
        - Recently, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has initiated the Science and Technology of Yoga and Meditation (SATYAM) programme.
        - Under SATYAM, DST has invited proposals to study appropriate intervention of[yoga](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/international-yoga-day) and meditation in fighting [Covid-19](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/coronavirus-disease-named-covid-19) and similar kinds of viruses.
        - Key Points
        - Objective: DST is encouraging scientists, clinicians and experienced practitioners of yoga and meditation, with a proven track record, to submit concept notes on the proposal covering:
            - Aims and objectives of proposed work.
            - Existing literature.
            - Methodology.
            - Expected outcome.
            - Budget requirement.
            - Details of host institutions along with detailed bio-data of the  principal investigator with latest publications included in scientific  journal databases.
        - Aim:
            - To provide assistance to society in today’s critical condition arising due to pandemic Covid-19.
            - This is a need-based call, therefore, proposed work should be completed within 6-12 months.
        - Dimensions of Covid: Covid-19 usually has three dimensions, related to:
            - Stress (worry, sitting at home).
            - Respiratory.
            - Immune system.
        - Scientific Investigation: The effects of yoga and meditation on the life of a person during such stressful times have to be scientifically investigated.
        - Sometimes, there is an empirical correlation in the actions and the outcome, but it needs to be understood scientifically.
        - Modern Tools: All the participants are expected to work together using the modern tools of life science and bio-sciences to understand what works and what does not.

- **Austerity Measures**
    - [Austerity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/austerity.asp) ,  a word that characterizes severity or sternness, is used in economics  to refer to austerity measures. These are economic policies implemented  by a government to reduce [public-sector debt](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/usa-national-debt/) , by significantly curtailing [government spending](https://www.investopedia.com/government-spending-and-debt-4689795) , particularly when a nation is in jeopardy of defaulting on its bonds.
    - Policies that are considered austerity measures include an increase  in taxes, cutting back on government programs, such as healthcare  services and aid to veterans, a reduction in pensions, and a reduction  in salaries and wages for government employees. Depending on how austerity measures are implemented, they can make  life difficult for citizens due to less available social services and  less disposable income.
    - 
- **Fiscal Prundence**
    - Fiscal  prudence has a lot in common with fiscal consolidation and/or  “austerity”, where government takes stringent steps to curb the  inflation and correct fiscal deficit. Governments around the globe  follow ‘prudent fiscal policies’ such as
        - Cutting government spending
        - Limiting perks and allownces to government employees and trying to make PSUs profitable.
        - Increasing tax rate
    - Means when your expenses are according to your planned expenditure and your budget doesn’t suffe a deficiet. Means when your expenses are according to your planned expenditure and your budget doesn't suffer  a deficiet

- **BhaaratNet Scheme**
    - BharatNet is a flagship mission implemented by [Bharat Broadband Network Ltd.](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bbnl-and-dark-fibre)  (BBNL).
    - Currently, it is being implemented by the Department of Telecommunication under the Ministry of Communications.
    - It is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up by the Government of India under the Companies Act, 1956 with an authorized capital of Rs 1000 crore.
    - Initially, it was under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which was bifurcated into the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in July 2016.
    - National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) was launched in October 2011 and was renamed as Bharat Net Project in 2015.
        - National Optical Fibre Network:
            - It was envisaged as an information superhighway through the creation of a robust middle-mile infrastructure for reaching broadband connectivity to Gram Panchayats.
            - The Ministry of Communications has launched the[National Broadband Mission](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/national-broadband-mission)that  will facilitate universal and equitable access to broadband services  across the country, especially in rural and remote areas.
            - Non-discriminatory access to the NOFN was provided  to all the service providers like Telecom Service Providers (TSPs),  Cable TV operators and content providers to launch various services in  rural areas.
        - Aim:
            - To facilitate the delivery of [e-governance](https://www.drishtiias.com/to-the-points/Paper2/e-governance-1), e-health, e-education, e-banking, Internet and other services to rural India.
            - To connect all the 2,50,000 Gram panchayats in the country and provide 100 Mbps connectivity to all gram panchayats.
            - To achieve this, the existing unused fibres (dark fibre)  of public sector undertakings (PSUs) (BSNL, Railtel and Power Grid)  were utilised and incremental fibre was laid to connect to Gram  Panchayats wherever necessary.
            - The entire project is being funded by the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), which was set up for improving telecom services in rural and remote areas of the country.
        - Implementation:
            - The project is a Centre-State collaborative project, with the states contributing free Rights of Way for establishing the Optical Fibre Network.
            - The three-phase implementation of the BharatNet project is as follows:
                - First Phase: Provide one lakh gram panchayats with broadband connectivity by laying underground optic fibre cable (OFC) lines by December 2017.
                - Second Phase: Provide connectivity to all the gram  panchayats in the country using an optimal mix of underground fibre,  fibre over power lines, radio and satellite media. It is to be completed  by March 2019.
                - Third Phase: From 2019 to 2023, a state-of-the-art,  future-proof network, including fibre between districts and blocks,  with ring topology to provide redundancy would be created.
            - The participation of states became important in the second phase which involved laying of OFC over electricity poles. This was a new element of the BharatNet strategy as the mode of connectivity by aerial OFC has several advantages, including lower cost, speedier implementation, easy maintenance and utilization of existing power line infrastructure.
- **Viability Gap Funding (VGF) Scheme**
    - Viability Gap Finance means a grant to support projects that are economically justified but not financially viable.
    - The scheme is designed as a Plan Scheme to be administered by the  Ministry of Finance and amount in the budget are made on a year-to-year  basis.
    - Such a grant under VGF is provided as a capital subsidy to attract  the private sector players to participate in PPP projects that are  otherwise financially unviable.
    - Projects may not be commercially viable because of the long gestation period and small revenue flows in future.
    - The VGF scheme was launched in 2004 to support projects that come under Public-Private Partnerships.
        - Its’ funding
            - Funds for VGF will be provided from the government’s budgetary  allocation. Sometimes it is also provided by the statutory authority who  owns the project asset.
            - If the sponsoring Ministry/State Government/ statutory entity aims  to provide assistance over and above the stipulated amount under VGF, it  will be restricted to a further 20% of the total project cost.
        - VGF grants
            - VGF grants will be available only for infrastructure projects where  private sector sponsors are selected through a process of competitive  bidding.
            - The VGF grant will be disbursed at the construction stage itself but  only after the private sector developer makes the equity contribution  required for the project.
    - Now, under this scheme, private sector projects in areas like  wastewater treatment, solid waste management, health, water supply and  education, could get 30% of the total project cost from the Centre.
    - Separately, pilot projects in health and education, with at least  50% operational cost recovery, can get as much as 40% of the total  project cost from the central government.
    - The Centre and States would together bear 80% of the capital cost of  the project and 50% of operation and maintenance costs of such projects  for the first five years.
- **Import Expor**t
    - As per the Economic Survey 2019-20; Petroleum products are the biggest exporting item from India. It accounts for a 14% share of total Indian export followed by precious stones with 7.87%.
    - Indias's exports = Petroleum products, Mineral fuels including  oil, Gems, precious metals, Machinery including computers, Organic,  Electrical machinery, equipment, chemicals, iron, steel, and  Pharmaceuticals products.
    - India's imports = Crude petroleum, gold, pearls, precious  stones, petroleum products, Telecom instruments, electronic components,  industrial machinery, electronic components, Animal/vegetable fats,  oils, waxes, Plastics, plastic articles, and medical apparatus.
    - At present the Indian economy has become the 5th largest economy (nominal GDP) in the world. The government of India has set up an export target of $900 billion by 2020 in the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020. This target is just double to its total export of $465.9 billion in 2013-14.
    - The value of India export was around US$ 356.96 billion in  April-November 2019. The largest destination for India's export was the  USA. It accounts for 15.88% of Indian export. On the other hand, the  largest source of India's import was from China.
    - The above table depicts that the USA is the biggest destination for  Indian export followed by the United Arab Emirates. Now let us have a  look at the top 10 biggest import sources of India in 2018-19.
    - The bilateral trade between India and the USA was USD 87.95 billion  in 2018-19. India has a trade surplus of USD 16.85 billion with America  in the same period. This trade surplus has come down to $15.17 billion  in January 2020.
    - So this was the list of the largest source of Indian import and  export destinations of India. This is a very important article for  Banking/SSC/State PSC exams.
    - The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea is a document (written by  an anonymous sailor from Alexandria about AD 100) describing trade  between countries, including India.
        - Since 1498, Europeans did trade with the rulers of India using the  sea route. The main export items then were spices like pepper, ginger,  cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, mace, and cloves.
        - From 1947-1991, the Indian economy remained largely as a closed  economy. High taxes were levied on import of items. Foreign investments  like FDI were restricted.
        - However, after the liberalisation in 1991, foreign trade improved significantly.
    - Exports and Imports
        - Now, India exports around 7500 commodities to about 190 countries,  and imports around 6000 commodities from 140 countries. Exports and  Imports are not only restricted to commodities (merchandise). Service is  also a major export/import item.
    - To make it simple, let’s summarise foreign trade of India as below:

    - Key Points
    - Telemedicine: As per the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://www.drishtiias.com/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-international-institution/world-health-organization-who), telemedicine is the delivery of health care services, where distance is a critical factor, by all health care professionals using Information Technology (IT)  for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease and injuries,  research and evaluation, etc, all in the interests of advancing the  health of individuals and their communities.
        - Tele-consultation is one of the applications of telemedicine. It uses IT to facilitate communications between a patient and a doctor who are otherwise geographically separated.
    - eSanjeevani:
        - It is a doctor to doctor telemedicine system, being implemented under the [Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWCs) programme](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/ayushmanbharat).
            - AB-HWCs are envisaged to be the platform for delivery of an expanded  range of primary health care services closer to the communities.
        - It seeks to connect all 1,50,000 HWCs using the hub-and-spoke model by December 2022.
            - Under the model, a network will be established comprising an anchor  establishment, or hub, which offers a full array of services, and will  be complemented by secondary establishments, or spokes, which offer  limited services, routing patients needing more intensive services to  the hub for treatment.
        - Presently, telemedicine is being provided through more than 3,000 HWCs in 10 States.
    - eSanjeevaniOPD:
        - It was launched amid the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/coronavirus-disease-named-covid-19) to enable patient-to-doctor tele-consultations.
        - Offered at no cost, this e-health service has made it convenient for the people to avail of the health services without having to travel. It enables two-way interaction and even generates a prescription slip.
        - It is hosting over 40 online Out Patient Department (OPD) services, more than half of these are speciality OPDs which include Gynaecology, Psychiatry, [AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) for the AIDS/HIV patients](https://www.drishtiias.com/loksabha-rajyasabha-discussions/hiv-new-hope), [Non-Communicable Disease (NCD)](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/non-communicable-diseases-in-india) etc.
    - Way Forward
        - These platforms can be a gamechanger for people in the rural areas who do not have easy access to medical specialists located in cities.
        - Telemedicine saves time and cost. Further, these platforms are in line with the government’s vision of [‘Digital India’](https://www.drishtiias.com/loksabha-rajyasabha-discussions/in-depth-digital-india) and necessary to tackle situations created by a pandemic like Covid-19.

- NIPUN
    - Union  government is set to launch a new scheme called “NIPUN Bharat  Initiative” on July 5, 2021. It will be launched to improve numeracy,  foundational reading, and understanding for early-stage students.
    - 'NIPUN Bharat Mission’
        - NIPUN stands for “National Initiative for Proficiency in reading with Understanding and Numeracy”.
        - This  scheme would provide an enabling environment in a bid to ensure  universal acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy.
        - It  will ensure that every child achieves desired learning competencies in  reading, writing, and numeracy by end of Grade 3, by the year 2026-27.
        - This initiative will be a part of school education programme, Samagra Shiksha.
    - Which is the implementing agency?
    - NIPUN  Bharat initiative will be implemented by school education department of  Union government. In order to implement it, a five-tier implementation  mechanism will be set up at national, state, district, block, and school  levels across all states and Union territories.
    - Why this scheme was launched?
    - Foundational  learning has been a drawback in Indian schools. As per Annual Status of  Education Report (Aser) findings, for successive years bulk of Indian  students pursuing elementary education in schools cannot even read,  understand or do basic arithmetic. Thus, this initiative was launched to  tackle this issue. This scheme is in line with new education policy.
    - ASER Findings 2020
        - 25%  of school-going children in four to eight age group do not have  age-appropriate cognitive and numeracy skills. Thus, there is a huge  learning deficit at very early stage.
        - 4% of children below age of six are able to recognize at least letters.
        - 6% can do additions.
        - 8% of children in Class II can read a text of classes below them.
        - 8% of students in Class III, can read texts meant for students two levels below them.
    - Aim: To create an enabling environment to  ensure universal acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy. It  will enable every child to achieve the desired learning competencies in  reading, writing and numeracy by the end of Grade 3 by 2026-27.
    - Implementation: NIPUN Bharat will be implemented by the Department of School Education and Literacy.
    - Mechanism: A  five-tier implementation mechanism will be set up at the national-  state- district- block- school level in all states and UTs for the  mission.
    - Funding: No additional funding is being allocated for the mission. Instead, money is being allocated from the Samagra Shiksha scheme, which saw a 20% drop in its budget in 2021.
    - Significance: Foundational literacy and numeracy is one of the goals under the National Education Policy 2020.
        - Initially, the policy had  included a 2025 deadline to achieve this goal. But the target has been  extended to 2026-27, given that COVID-19 has already disrupted two  academic years.

- PPP
    - Purchasing power parity is a measurement of prices in different  countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute  purchasing power of the countries' currencies
    - **Purchasing power parity**  (**PPP** )[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity#cite_note-Krugman2-1)  is a measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power)  of the countries' [currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency) . In many cases PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the [basket of goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_of_goods)   at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a  different location. The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from  the [market exchange rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate)  because of poverty, tariffs, and other [transaction costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost) .
- AntiTrust
    - What Is Antitrust?
    - Antitrust laws are regulations that encourage competition by limiting the [market power](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-power.asp) of any particular firm. This often involves ensuring that [mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) don't overly concentrate market power or form [monopolies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopoly.asp), as well as breaking up firms that have become monopolies. Antitrust laws also prevent multiple firms from [colluding](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collusion.asp) or forming a [cartel](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cartel.asp) to limit competition through practices such as [price fixing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricefixing.asp).  Due to the complexity of deciding what practices will limit  competition, antitrust law has become a distinct legal specialization.
    - Understanding Antitrust
    - Antitrust laws are the broad group of state and federal laws that are  designed to make sure businesses are competing fairly. Supporters say  antitrust laws are necessary for an open marketplace. Healthy  competition among [sellers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seller.asp)  gives consumers lower prices, higher-quality products and services,  more choices, and greater innovation. Opponents to antitrust laws argue  that allowing businesses to compete as they see fit would ultimately  give consumers the best prices.
    - 
    - The trust in antitrust refers to a group of businesses that team up or  form a monopoly in order to dictate pricing in a particular market.

- Fiat money is **a government-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold** .  Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because  they can control how much money is printed. Most modern paper  currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are fiat currencies.
