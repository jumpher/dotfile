- Subsidiary Alliance
    - Subsidiary Alliance was basically a treaty between  the British East India Company and the Indian princely states, by virtue  of which the Indian kingdoms lost their sovereignty to the English. It  also was a major process that led to the building of the British Empire  in India. It was framed by Lord Wellesley, the Governor-General of India  from 1798 to 1805. It was actually used for the first time by the  French Governor-General Marquis Dupleix.
    - The Nawab of Awadh was the first ruler to enter into  the subsidiary alliance with the British after the Battle of Buxar.  However, The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to accept a well-framed  subsidiary alliance.
    - **Features of the Subsidiary Alliance Treaty**
        - The subsidiary alliance in India was planned by Lord Wellesley but this term was introduced by French Governor Dupleix
        - An Indian ruler entering into Subsidiary Alliance with the British  had to dissolve his own armed forces and accept British forces in his  territory.
        - He also had to pay for the British army’s maintenance. If he failed  to make the payment, a portion of his territory would be taken away and  ceded to the British.
        - In return, the British would protect the Indian state against any foreign attack or internal revolt.
        - The British promised non-interference in internal affairs of the Indian state but this was rarely kept.
        - The Indian state could not enter into any alliance with any other foreign power.
        - He could also not employ any other foreign nationals other than  Englishmen in his service. And, if he were employing any, on the signing  of the alliance, he had to terminate them from his service. The idea  was to curb the influence of the French.
        - The Indian state could also not enter into any political connection with another Indian state without British approval.
        - The Indian ruler, thus, lost all powers in respect of foreign affairs and the military.
        - He virtually lost all his independence and became a British ‘protectorate’.
        - A British Resident was also stationed in the Indian Court.
    - Effects of the Subsidiary Alliance
        - As a result of Indian rulers disbanding their armies, many people were rendered unemployed.
        - Many Indian states lost their independence and slowly, most parts of India were coming under British control.
        - The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to accept the Subsidiary Alliance in 1798.
        - Lord Clive also introduced the subsidiary system in Oudh and the  Treaty of Allahabad was signed where the British promised the Oudh  territory from enemies like Marathas.

- Doctrine of Lapse
    - The Doctrine of Lapse was an annexation policy followed widely by  Lord Dalhousie when he was India’s Governor-General from 1848 to 1856.  It was used as an administrative policy for the extension of British  perspectives.
    - Who was Lord Dalhousie & What is the Doctrine of Lapse?
    - James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st  Marquess of Dalhousie, known commonly as Lord Dalhousie, was the  Governor-General of India from 1848 to 1856. He had been a famous  Scottish statesman.
    - Now, although he is commonly  associated with the Doctrine of Lapse, it was devised by the Court of  Directors of the East India Company as early as 1847 and several smaller  states had already been annexed under this doctrine before Lord  Dalhousie took the position of the Governor-General. The policy was used  far more extensively by him to expand the territorial reach of the  East-India Company.
    - The Doctrine of Lapse was an  annexation policy extensively applied by East India Company in India  until 1859. The doctrine stated that any princely state under the  vassalage of the company will how its territory annexed should the ruler  of the said state fail to produce an heir. The doctrine and its  application were regarded by many Indians as illegitimate.
    - The Doctrine of Lapse was one of the underlying factors that led to the revolt of 1857.

    - Features of Doctrine of Lapse
        - Before the introduction of this  doctrine, the princely states had a ritualised method of adoption  practised for centuries  An heir apparent would eventually be selected  from a pool of candidates, who were groomed for succession from an early  age, called bhayats if no competent born-to son were produced (an  obviously unsuitable or treasonous born-to son could be excluded from  the succession).
        - If the ruler died before adopting a  successor, one of his widows could adopt an heir, who would immediately  accede to the throne. The adoptee would cut all ties with his birth  family. Once the Doctrine of Lapse came into place the following  features were now faced by the Indian rulers.
        - According  to this doctrine, any princely state under the direct or indirect (as a  vassal) control of the East India Company, should the ruler not produce a  legal male heir, would be annexed by the company.
        - This was  not introduced by Lord Dalhousie even though it was he who documented it  and used it widely to acquire territories for the British.
        - As per  this, any adopted son of the Indian ruler could not be proclaimed as  heir to the kingdom. The adopted son would only inherit his foster  father’s personal property and estates.
        - The adopted son would also not be entitled to any pension that his father had been receiving or to any of his father’s titles.
        - This challenged the Indian ruler’s long-held authority to appoint an heir of their choice.

    - It was as per this policy that Nana Sahib, the adopted son of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II was denied his titles and pension.
    - The final moment straw came when **Awadh** was annexed to the English East India Company under the terms of the **Doctrine of Lapse** on the grounds of internal misrule on 7 February 1856 AD. This annexation was one of the reasons for the [Revolt of 1857](https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/revolt-of-1857-political-economic-factors/).
    - Effects of Doctrine of Lapse
        - Many Indian states lost their sovereignty and became British territories.
        - A lot of people were unhappy with the ‘illegal’ nature of this  doctrine and this was one of the causes of the Indian Revolt of 1857.
        - Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi had grievances against the British  because the former’s pension was stopped by the British after his  foster father died, and the Rani’s adopted son was denied the throne  under the doctrine of lapse.
        - Dalhousie returned to Britain in 1856. After the Indian Revolt broke  out in 1857, his governance was widely criticised as one of the causes  of the rebellion.
        - This led to a lot of unrest among the Indian princes.

    - Governor General 1813-1823
    - Under his law company became supreme law
    - The paramount power and to protect its interest, the company justified the annexations of any Indian kingdom. Under this process when the British tried to annex the small states of karnataka Rani channamma led an anti-British resistence movement
        - She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison
    - Under Robert Clive, the company was appointed as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. He became the first British Governor of the Bengal presidency and benefited the English company with the Diwani system.Lord Wellesley who was the fifth Governor-General of India from 1798 to 1805. He introduced the doctrine of the subsidiary alliance. As per this policy, the Indian states were forced to accept the settlements of British forces within their territory and had to pay a subsidiary for their maintenance. Lord Dalhousie was the Governor-General from 1848 to 1856. Under his rule, he introduced the policy of annexation which came to be known as a doctrine of lapse. According to the policy if an Indian ruler died without a male successor his Kingdom would automatically lapse or fall into the company's territory. It also mentioned that the ruler cannot adopt the male successor as it should be the natural one. In 1830 East India company carried out several annexation programs to secure their control over the north-west. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan and established indirect company rule there. Later Punjab and Sindh were also annexed in different periods
    - The ascent to paramountcy
        - At  that point a radical change occurred in British policy. Two causes were  principally responsible. There was a growing body of opinion within the  company that only British control of India could end the constant wars  and provide really satisfactory conditions for trade; full [dominion](https://www.britannica.com/topic/imperialism)  would be economical as well as salutary. The more-compelling immediate  cause was the transformation of European politics by the [French Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution). A new French threat to India emerged, this time overland, with [Napoleon I’s](https://www.britannica.com/event/Napoleonic-Wars)  Egyptian expedition of 1798–99. It was certain that a French army under  such a leader would find many friends in India to welcome it, not least  [Tippu Sultan](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tippu-Sultan).

        - India, 1797–1805.
        - The government of [Lord Wellesley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Colley-Wellesley-Marquess-Wellesley)
            - The next governor-general, Lord Mornington (later [Richard Colley Wellesley, Marquess Wellesley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Colley-Wellesley-Marquess-Wellesley)), combined the [convictions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/convictions) of the imperialist group with a [mandate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandate)  to deal with the French. Wellesley was thus able to use this fear of  the French as a cover for his imperialism until he was near to complete  success. His term of office (1798–1805) was therefore a decisive period  in the rise of the British dominion.
            - Wellesley decided first to strike at Mysore, still a [formidable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formidable) military power and avowedly hostile. He had little difficulty getting the nizam for an ally and securing the neutrality of the peshwa. The nizam, hard pressed by the Marathas, was persuaded to disband his [contingent](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contingent)  of French-trained troops in return for a promise of protection. This  was the first of Wellesley’s subsidiary treaties. Tippu Sultan had  entertained French republican envoys and had planted a tree of liberty  at [Seringapatam](https://www.britannica.com/place/Shrirangapattana), but when the British stormed Seringapatam in May 1799 he was isolated and at bay, and he found too late that [concessions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/concessions), in the Indian tradition, would not save him. Tippu Sultan died fighting in the [breach](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/breach).  Wellesley tempered his imperialism with diplomacy by restoring the  child head of the old Hindu reigning family as the ruler of half of  Tippu Sultan’s dominions; the other half was divided between the nizam  and the company. This substantially enlarged the area of the [Madras](https://www.britannica.com/place/Chennai) presidency.
            - For the next three years Wellesley was occupied with certain exercises in [realpolitik](https://www.britannica.com/topic/realpolitik)  and with developing his device of the subsidiary treaty. The  realpolitik was evidenced in four directions. On the death (1801) of the  reigning [Carnatic](https://www.britannica.com/place/Karnataka-linguistic-region-India)  nawab, Wellesley took over his territories, pensioning the new nawab  with one-fifth of the revenue. The same fate befell the small but highly  [cultivated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivated) state of [Tanjore](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thanjavur-India) (1799) and the port city of [Surat](https://www.britannica.com/place/Surat) on a disputed succession.
            - The biggest of these exercises concerned the Mughal successor state of [Avadh](https://www.britannica.com/place/Awadh)  in northern India, which had been in treaty relationship with the  company since 1765. This rich state had fallen into disorder under the  listless though [cultured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultured) rule of Āṣaf  al-Dawlah; on his death in 1797 a succession dispute and an Afghan  invasion of the Punjab gave Wellesley a welcome opportunity for  interference. He pressed the nawab to disband his troops and increase  his payment to the company for his subsidiary force. When the nawab made  an offer to [abdicate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abdicate),  it was accepted immediately; but, on finding that abdication would mean  annexation and not his son’s succession, he withdrew it, and Wellesley  treated him as rebellious. In 1801 Wellesley annexed half the state,  including the [Ganges–Yamuna Doab](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ganges-Yamuna-Doab) and almost all of [Rohilkhand](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rohilkhand).  Whatever the verdict on the means employed, this move had important  consequences. Avadh was isolated, and a jumping-off place was secured  for an attack on the northern Marathas. The company was no longer  looking for buffer states as shields against attack but for territory  that would serve as springboards for offensive action.
            - This change of attitude applies to Wellesley’s development of the subsidiary  system. In the hands of Clive and Hastings, it was a defensive  instrument to safeguard the company’s possessions; in the hands of  Wellesley, it became an offensive device with which to subject  independent states to British control. The essence of the system was  that the company undertook to protect a state from external attack in  return for control of its [foreign relations](https://www.britannica.com/topic/international-relations).  For this purpose it provided a subsidiary force of company troops, who  were commonly stationed in a cantonment near the state capital. The  state paid for this force by means of a subsidy, which was often  commuted into ceding territory. In order to protect itself from an  external enemy, the state in question bound itself irrevocably to the  British power, providing at the heart, as it were, the means of its own  coercion should it ever wish to resume independence.
            - Wellesley first applied this system in 1798 to [Hyderabad](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hyderabad-historical-state-India), when the aging [Niẓām ʿAlī Khan](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-Ali-Khan) was in dire fear of the Marathas. In 1800 the subsidy was [compounded](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compounded) for the nizam’s share of the [Mysore](https://www.britannica.com/place/Karnataka-state-India)  annexations. The same system was applied to Avadh, when the great  annexation of 1801 was said to be on account of the subsidiary force. It  was then the turn of the Marathas—one of the few remaining [bastions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bastions)  of Indian independence. Had the Maratha chiefs remained united,  Wellesley could have accomplished little; the death of the young peshwa released fresh dissensions, however, heightened by the death of the minister Nana Fadnavis in 1800. The chiefs [Holkar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jaswant-Rao-Holkar) and [Dawlat Rao Sindhia](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Daulat-Rao-Sindhia) contended for power over the peshwa, [Baj Rao II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Baji-Rao-II).  On Holkar’s success in 1802, Baji Rao fled to Bassein and applied for  British aid. Such an opportunity at the centre of Maratha power was not  to be missed; there was also the justification that Dawlat Rao Sindhia,  in the north, had 40,000 French-trained troops under a French commander.  The [Treaty of Bassein](https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Bassein) (December 31, 1802) placed, as it were, a time bomb at the heart of the Maratha confederacy; British troops were stationed at [Pune](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pune), at the price of a cession of territory, and the peshwa was reduced to [dependency](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dependency) on the British. (See [Sindhia family](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sindhia-family); [Holkar dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Holkar-dynasty).)
            - This action provoked the Second [Maratha War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Maratha-Wars)—at  first against Dawlat Rao Sindhia and Raghuji Bhonsle and then against  Holkar. At first the British won resounding victories. Wellesley’s  brother Arthur (later [Arthur Wellesley, 1st duke of Wellington](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arthur-Wellesley-1st-Duke-of-Wellington)) defeated the [Sindhia-](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sindhia-family)[Bhonsle](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bhonsle-Dynasty) coalition in west-central India, while [Lord Lake](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerard-Lake-1st-Viscount-Lake) ([Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerard-Lake-1st-Viscount-Lake)) broke up Sindhia’s French army, occupied [Delhi](https://www.britannica.com/place/Delhi), and took the aged emperor [Shah ʿĀlam II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shah-Alam-II)  under protection. Then came a check, however, with the intervention of  Holkar using the old Maratha cavalry tactics, forcing the British to  retreat, and besieging Delhi. Though Holkar was later defeated, this was  the signal for which [exasperated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exasperated) directors and a doubting ministry had been waiting. Wellesley was recalled. His race for [hegemony](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony) had been lost in the last lap. But [Wellesley’s](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Colley-Wellesley-Marquess-Wellesley)  work, avowedly imperialistic, made ultimate supremacy inevitable. The  Marathas were too broken to reunite, and there was no one to take their  place. (See [Treaty of Surji-Arjungaon](https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Surji-Arjungaon).)
                - The government of Lord Minto
                    - The next 10 years were an interlude, not a new era. During that period both Sindhia and Holkar plundered the chiefs of [Rajasthan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rajasthan), thus preparing them mentally for future British overlordship. Meanwhile, bands of freebooters known as [Pindaris](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pindari) raided the [Nagpur](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nagpur-India)  (home of the Bhonsle dynasty) and Hyderabad states in widening circles  and thence entered British territory. These were dispossessed villagers  and discarded soldiers—the human flotsam and jetsam of the frequent  wars. They had the elusiveness of guerrillas, and they received the  tacit [countenance](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/countenance) of the Maratha princes but not the goodwill of the population, who were their principal victims.
                    - Lord [Minto](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound-1st-Earl-of-Minto) (governor-general 1807–13) was occupied with the revived [French](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-France) danger, which was once again serious with the Treaty of [Tilsit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Treaties-of-Tilsit) (1807) and [Napoleon I’s](https://www.britannica.com/event/Napoleonic-Wars) resulting alliance with [Russia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Russia). To guard against a French-sponsored Russian attack, British missions were sent to [Afghanistan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Afghanistan), to Persia, and to [Ranjit Singh](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ranjit-Singh-Sikh-maharaja), the [Sikh](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism) ruler of the Punjab. The first two proved fruitless, but the [Treaty of Amritsar](https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-Amritsar)  (1809) with Ranjit Singh defined British and Sikh spheres of influence  and settled relations for a generation. Minto’s other achievement was  the capture of the [Île de France](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauritius) (Mauritius) and [Java](https://www.britannica.com/place/Java-island-Indonesia)  from the French-controlled Dutch; the former island became a colony,  and the latter was restored to the Dutch under the peace treaty. One  result of this episode was the acquisition of the key point of [Singapore](https://www.britannica.com/place/Singapore) by [Sir Stamford Raffles](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stamford-Raffles) in 1819.
- Bengal Tenancy Act 1885
    - **Bengal Tenancy Act 1885** was an enactment of the Bengal government defining the natural rights and liabilities of [zamindars](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Zamindar) and tenants in response to widespread peasant discontent threatening the stability of the colonial system of governance. The [permanent settlement](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Permanent_settlement&action=edit&redlink=1)  gave absolute proprietary rights to landholders but was silent about  the rights of tenants, although it vaguely recognised their customary  rights. With the increase of population and rise of prices of  agricultural produce in the nineteenth century, demand for land  increased. In consequence, zamindars tended to enhance rents. The [raiyats](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Raiyat) (tenants) refused to accept the zamindari right to enhance rent beyond [pargana](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Pargana) __  nirikh __   (rate) established by custom. Zamindars, as absolute proprietors of  land, were not inclined to recognise such customary rights.
    - Another very important factor that contributed to the  deteriorating relationship between zamindars and tenants was the  emergence of a landed intermediate class defying the rules of the  Permanent Settlement. The [madhyasvatvas](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Madhyasvatva) or intermediate interests acquired their rights by purchase. In the statute book, the  __ madhyasvatvas __   (Subinfeudation) did not exist. The law courts were giving conflicting  judgments as regards the rights and liabilities of the intermediate  classes and also of the peasants. The operation of the Permanent  Settlement and the growth of commercial crops led to the rise of a rich  peasantry which was quite close to the landed class in riches and social  influence, but their rights over land were not very clear under the  laws of the Permanent Settlement. The government tried to accommodate  this class by enacting the Rent Act of 1859. But the discontents of the  peasantry did not subside.
    - From the mid-nineteenth century, peasant resistance movements  assumed alarming proportion. In the 1870s, the landlord-tenant relation  deteriorated so much in almost all districts, particularly in the [jute](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Jute) growing districts of eastern Bengal, that peasant  __ jotes __   or combinations were formed to resist zemindari attempts to subvert  their customary rights in land. To contain the situation and to adopt  necessary measures to improve relations between landlord and tenants, a  Rent Commission was set up in 1880.
    - In the light of the recommendations and observations of the Rent  Commission, the Bengal Legislative Council enacted Act III of 1885. This  Act is popularly known in legal circle as the Bengal Tenancy Act. The  Act defined rights and obligations of intermediate tenancies and  __ raiyati __  tenancies. However, inferior tenancies such as  __ kurfa __ ,  __ barga __ ,  __ ch'__  __**a'**__  __kran __ , nankar __ , kar'__  __**s'**__  __ha __   and so on still remained undefined. The Act also enacted rules for  undertaking a detailed Survey and Settlement Operation of all holdings  and their holders so that a reliable record of rights could be prepared  for different interests in land from zamindars to ordinary raiyats.
        - **Bengal Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1928** was enacted by the [bengal legislative council](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bengal_legislative_council&action=edit&redlink=1) in response to the demands of the under-raiyats. Though the rights of settled  __ __ [ __raiyat__ ](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Raiyat) __ __ s  were clearly defined, yet the rights of under-raiyats remained vaguely  defined by the Bengal Tenancy Act of 1885. The under-raiyats of various  brands ( __ barg'__  __**a'**__  __d'__  __**a'**__  __r __ s __ , karsh'__  __**a'**__  __d'__  __**a'**__  __r __ s __ , kurfa and dh'__  __**a'**__  __nkar'__  __**a'**__  __ri __   __ raiyat __ s)  cultivated not on regular settlement, but on temporary and competitive  basis. In view of the abundance of land at the time, they could  cultivate land, on negotiation, at much lesser rent than the settled  occupancy raiyats. This variety of competitive raiyats were generally  known as under-raiyats and their relative position was not too bad until  land-man ration was in favour of man. But with the growth of  population, the pressure on land increased significantly by the end of  the nineteenth century, particularly from the beginning of the twentieth  century. The down turn trend of the economy of the under-raiyats was  getting increasingly worse due to scarcity of land and phenomenal rise  in rental demands on them.
    - With the introduction of electoral politics  under the constitutional reforms Act of 1919, the elected  representatives in the council became vocal about the rights of  under-raiyats. Consequent upon the rise of communist movement in Bengal,  public opinion became increasingly critical about the status of the  under-raiyats, who constituted a major segment of the Bengal peasantry.  In response to demands from various peasant organisations and political  parties, the Bengal government introduced the Bengal Tenancy (Amendment)  Bill in the Council. It proposed to give rights in land to those  under-raiyats who were in continuous possession of their land for more  than twelve years. It also proposed to give rights to sharecropping  tenants in long possession of lands.
    - The Bill was strongly opposed by the landed  interests in the legislature, but was supported by pro-peasant parties  including the Muslim members.
