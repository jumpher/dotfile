Removal of intrusive DRM, and hardware requirements (for instance requiring a Wii U to play Wii U games, or a 7th gen intel for 4k blu rays).
DRM can be very intrusive, certain types have even been known to install rootkits. And usually the only way to remove DRM is to make a copy, which could be considered piracy.
For instance ripping Blu-ray's (or downloading another copy) so that I don't need to use special software to open them and can just use standard VLC, with no hickups.
Ironically the very things that are created to prevent piracy encourage it.




Heinrich's Pyramid


One day my girlfriend (at the time) and I were doing an internship in Orlando. We had been fighting a lot, were on the brink of breaking up, and it was just a really tough but pivotal moment in our lives. There was a lot of growing that was about to happe. Anyways, one day we were fighting about where to go to eat. We decided to walk to the Hurricane Grill around the corner from our apartment complex. As we're arguing while we walk in, some random dude walks right up to us, gestures his hands out towards us for us to take his hand and says "come on, lets go in I'll grab us a table. Let's talk". Alarms are going off in my head and I'm trying to make sure that this guy isnt trying to drug us or hurt my girlfriend, but he seemed safe and oddly confident. He picked a table, ordered food, and just started having the deepest conversations with us about relationships, marriage, life, our personal goals. We were not drinking alcohol. At one point in the dinner he looks over to me starts fucking crying and says "You are going to accomplish everything you want and more, stop doubting yourself so much." It was bizarre because I could feel how much he meant that, it felt like he knew me. So I teared up too. Anyways, we finish the dinner, he gives both of us a big hug, pays for everything and then when we ask him if he needs a ride home or anything he says no it's ok, and then he just starts walking towards some bushes/trees. Never see him again.







He was a customer I was helping out. Honestly there was nothing that really stood out with him. He was handsome, but in a normal way. He dressed normal. Talked normal. Was blandly friendly, as you are with strangers. Just a normal upper-middle class type guy. The only thing that really stood out was his blue eyes. Not in a goofy supernatural type way, he just had very very blue eyes.
But for some reason he made every hair on my neck stand on end. Alarm bells were going off in my head like crazy, all I wanted to do was hide. I have NEVER felt this way, before or since. Even when I was followed home by someone, I have never felt such gut deep "you are in danger" as I did with this guy.

After ringing him through, he reached out to shake my hand. This is not common at all here, but out of politeness I took it and shook. And I INSTANTLY got so nauseous I almost gagged. The moment I got nauseous he just held my hand and smiled, and something in that smile made me absolutely sure he knew what I was feeling and he enjoyed it. I'm not religious in any way, but I remember thinking in that moment "oh fuck, is this the devil?"

After he left I was still so sick feeling I had to go to the back and sit down.

I'm not sure if he was a serial killer or what, but to this day I have never experienced something even close to that encounter. I absolutely felt bone deep certainty that I was in some sort of danger. I felt every bit the prey.

It's a hard story to explain, because it's all based on feelings, so I haven't told that many people about it. But to this day it is absolutely one of the scariest and weirdest things I have experienced.








Mongolia has never been rich. The area is very sparsely populated (it is the least dense country in the world now), it has very little land suited for agriculture, and the only thing to do on the steppes and the Gobi desert was herd livestock.

There was some industrialization during the communist period (1920 to 1990), but many of the factories were forced to close during the transition to democracy, since many of them werent profitable, but relied heavily on Soviet subsidies. Also, a lot of mismanagement occured then, most Mongolians had no idea how to live and work in a capitalist economy.

Things are beginning to change now. Mongolia has vast reserves of coal, copper, gold, iron, uranium rare earth minerals, and even some oil. Mongolia is already the top exporter of coking coal to China. If the politicians make decent decisions, our general situation could really improve drastically (and it already has begun to do so) in the coming years. Especially with such a low population.

Well as a indian youth i might be able to explain the situation a little better.

Basically we indians have a tendency to live with our parents (and at times our uncles and aunts and their families live with us), so naturally they have a decent control over our decisions right up to the age of 25-26 and at times even up till the 30s.

Now unfortunately most of the elders in our society have this stigma associated with things like sex and related education and since they control most of the society, these things are virtually absent in the public.

To make this situation even more complex, came the internet. Now the indian teens and young adults gained a window to look into what their counterparts in the west are doing, and we see them banging one another straight up from high school, while we are mostly still all virgins in college. We see movies like american pie (great movies btw) where hollywood potrays an even exaggerated version of an already pretty liberal society , atleast by our standards, and this makes us angry and frustrated as biologically we all are still the same and have same hormonal feelings etc.

This clash between the youth that wants a more free society and the elders who dont even consider it an option leads them to the only place where the adults dont have a significant control yet, the Internet.

Thus you find indian people on the internet desparate to get their sexual frustration off, meanwhile making us a butt of jokes and difficult for the rest of us here to have intellectual conversations with people from the other side of the globe.

This is one thing that has always concerned me. If you take the tech industry for example, roughly the same experience and skill-set would fetch you around $75k in the US and 7-8 LPA in India. If the $75k guy buys a thousand dollar iPhone, he's spending only 16% of his monthly salary. If you buy the same iPhone for 100k in India, you're spending 150% of your monthly salary. It's nuts when you think about it.
