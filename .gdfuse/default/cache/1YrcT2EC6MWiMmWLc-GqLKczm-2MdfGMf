- ^^Project Seabird^^
    - Project Seabird-Phase II:
        - Project Seabird involves construction of a naval base over an area of 11,169 acres.
        - Phase I comprised construction of a deep-sea  harbour, breakwaters dredging, a township, a naval hospital, a dockyard  uplift centre and a ship lift. It was completed in 2005.
        - Phase-II of Project Seabird was cleared by the [Cabinet Committee](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/cabinet-committees-formed) on Security in 2012. It envisages expanding facilities to house additional warships and set up a new Naval Air Station, among other plans.
        - INS Kadamba is currently the third-largest Indian naval base, and is expected to become the largest naval base in the eastern hemisphere after completion of expansion Phase II.
        - The Navy’s lone aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya is based at Karwar.  The base also has the country’s first sealift facility, a unique  “shiplift” and transfer system for docking and undocking ships and  submarines.
        - The project involves several technical and environmental challenges.
    - Efforts to Boost Self Reliance in Indian Navy:
        - More than two-thirds of the Navy's modernisation budget has been  spent on indigenous procurement in the last five financial years.
        - Out of the 48 ships and submarines, 46 are being inducted through indigenous construction.
        - [Project 75 (I)](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/project-75-india)  envisages indigenous construction of submarines equipped with the  state-of-the-art Air Independent Propulsion system at an estimated cost  of Rs. 43,000 crore.
        - [Aircraft Carrier Vikrant](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/ins-vikrant-first-indigenous-aircraft-carrier), likely to be commissioned in 2022, is a shining example of the Navy's self-reliance efforts.
        - The Navy is continuously strengthening India’s relations with its maritime neighbours with its focus on 'SAGAR' (Security & Growth for All in Region).
            - From rescuing stranded Indian nationals from affected countries to  ferrying-in critical equipment, including oxygen cylinders, from abroad,  Indian Navy has worked tirelessly in the fight against Covid-19 ([Operation Samudra Setu - I and II](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/operation-samudra-setu-ii)).
            - [SAGAR](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/mission-sagar) was launched in 2015. It is India’s strategic vision for the [Indian Ocean Region (IOR).](https://www.drishtiias.com/loksabha-rajyasabha-discussions/the-big-picture-india-s-vision-for-indo-pacific)
