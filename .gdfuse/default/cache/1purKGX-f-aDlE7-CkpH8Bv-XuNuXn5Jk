- The^^ Talukdars or Talukders,^^ were aristocrats who formed the ruling class during the Delhi Sultanate, Bengal Sultanate, Mughal Empire and British times. They were owners of a vast amount of lands, consistently hereditary, and were responsible for collecting taxes

- ^^**Jagirdars**^^  and ^^**Zamindars**^^
    - The Jagirdars
    - The Jagirdars were the king’s officials who enjoyed the land gifted from  the King. They were the rank (mansab) holder given by the king called  mansabdar. They were allotted non-inheritable land area equivalent to  their fee amount called Jagir.
    - These Jagirs are temporary in character and the Jagirdars only have  the right to claim and enjoy the revenue collected from the land. The  mansabs allotted were not the same for each year and revised from time  to time i.e. Jagirdars got promotion or demotions. Jagirdar having more  land area under him was more powerful and enjoyed the police  jurisdiction as well. The major portion of the land was in the form of  Jagirs.
        - The Jagirdars were not the permanent holder of land so they tried to  collect as much revenue possible from the land. The peasants and  Zamindars come under the Jagirdar. The Jagirdar had right to remove a  Zamindar, detain the peasants and brought them back in case they ran  away.
    - The Zamindars
        - The holder of land is termed as the Zamindar. They had the hereditary  right over the land to claim share in the peasant’s output other than  land revenues. They also have the right to detain the peasants. In most  of the Mughal period the Zamindar collected land revenue from the actual  tillers of land and for this they were allowed one tenth of the  collections either in cash or an equivalent amount of tax free land.
        - Zamindari right was also sold and bought like goods. Persons like  petty officials who accumulated wealth through grant of revenue  converted themselves into zamindars. Zamindari right could also be  mortgaged to money-lenders. Sometimes peasants of a Village also sold  away their right to a person who became the zamindar of that village.
