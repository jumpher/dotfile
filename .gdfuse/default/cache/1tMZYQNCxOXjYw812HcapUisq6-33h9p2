- **Anushilan Samiti**  ([Bengali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language) : অনুশীলন সমিতি, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation)  'bodybuilding society') was an Indian organisation in the first quarter of the 20th century that supported revolutionary violence as the means for ending [British rule in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_rule_in_India) . The organisation arose [from a conglomeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Anushilan_Samiti)  of local youth groups and gyms (akhara) in [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal)  in 1902. It had two prominent, somewhat independent, arms in [East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengal)  and [West Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal) , [Dhaka Anushilan Samiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Anushilan_Samiti)  (centred in [Dhaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka) , modern day [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) ), and the [Jugantar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugantar)  group (centred at [Calcutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata) ).
    - From its foundation to its dissolution during the 1930s, the Samiti challenged British rule in India by engaging in militant nationalism, including bombings, assassinations, and politically-motivated violence. The Samiti collaborated with other [revolutionary organisations in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_movement_for_Indian_independence) and abroad. It was led by the nationalists [Aurobindo Ghosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurobindo_Ghosh) and his brother [Barindra Ghosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barindra_Ghosh), and influenced by philosophies as diverse as [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu) [Shakta philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakti), as set forth by Bengali authors [Bankim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankim_Chandra_Chattopadhyay) and [Vivekananda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda), [Italian Nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonari), and the [Pan-Asianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Asianism) of [Kakuzo Okakura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuzo_Okakura). The Samiti was involved in a number of noted incidents of revolutionary attacks against British interests and administration in India, including [early attempts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alipore_bomb_case) to assassinate [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) officials. These were followed by the [1912 attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi-Lahore_Conspiracy) on the life of the Viceroy of India, and the [Seditious conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu-German_Conspiracy) during World War I, led by [Rash Behari Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash_Behari_Bose) and [Jatindranath Mukherjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatindranath_Mukherjee) respectively.
    - The organisation moved away from its philosophy of violence in the 1920s due to the influence of the [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) and the [Gandhian non-violent movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement). A section of the group, notably those associated with [Sachindranath Sanyal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachindranath_Sanyal), remained active in the revolutionary movement, founding the [Hindustan Republican Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Republican_Association) in north India. A number of Congress leaders from Bengal, especially [Subhash Chandra Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhash_Chandra_Bose), were accused by the British Government of having links with the organisation during this time.
    - The Samiti's violent and radical philosophy revived in the 1930s, when it was involved in the [Kakori conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakori_conspiracy), the [Chittagong armoury raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_armoury_raid), and other actions against the administration in British-occupied India.
    - Shortly after its inception, the organisation became the focus of an extensive police and intelligence operation which led to the founding of the [Special branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Branch) of the [Calcutta Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcutta_Police). Notable officers who led the police and intelligence operations against the  __ Samiti __  at various times included [Sir Robert Nathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Nathan), [Sir Harold Stuart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Harold_Stuart), [Sir Charles Stevenson-Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Stevenson-Moore) and [Sir Charles Tegart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Tegart). The threat posed by the activities of the  __ Samiti __  in Bengal during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), along with the threat of a [Ghadarite uprising in Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghadar_mutiny), led to the passage of [Defence of India Act 1915](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_of_India_Act_1915). These measures enabled the arrest, internment, transportation and execution of a number of revolutionaries linked to the organisation, which crushed the East Bengal Branch. In the aftermath of the war, the [Rowlatt committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_committee) recommended extending the Defence of India Act (as the [Rowlatt Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_Act)) to thwart any possible revival of the  __ Samiti __  in Bengal and the Ghadarite movement in Punjab. After the war, the activities of the party led to the implementation of the [Bengal Criminal Law Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Criminal_Law_Amendment) in the early 1920s, which reinstated the powers of incarceration and detention from the Defence of India Act. However, the  __ Anushilan Samiti __  gradually disseminated into the Gandhian movement. Some of its members left for the Indian National Congress then led by [Subhas Chandra Bose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhas_Chandra_Bose), while others identified more closely with [Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism). The  __ Jugantar __  branch formally dissolved in 1938. In independent India, the party in West Bengal evolved into the [Revolutionary Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Socialist_Party_(India)), while the Eastern Branch later evolved into the  __ __ [ __Shramik Krishak Samajbadi Dal__ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shramik_Krishak_Samajbadi_Dal) __ __  (Workers and Peasants Socialist Party) in present-day [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh).

- **Abhinav Bharat Society**  (Young India Society) was a [secret society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society) founded by [Vinayak Damodar Savarkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinayak_Damodar_Savarkar) and his brother [Ganesh Damodar Savarkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Damodar_Savarkar) in 1904.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-1) Initially founded at [Nasik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasik) as "Mitra Mela" when Vinayak Savarkar was still a student of [Fergusson College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergusson_College) at [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), the society grew to include several hundred revolutionaries and political activists with branches in various parts of India, extending to London after Savarkar went to study law. It carried out a few assassinations of British officials, after which the Savarkar brothers were convicted and imprisoned. The society was formally disbanded in 1952.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-Jaffrelot26-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-Teltumbde212-3)
    - Vinayak Savarkar and [Ganesh Savarkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_Savarkar)  started  __ Mitra Mela __  , a revolutionary secret society in Nasik in 1899. It was one among several such  __ melas __   (revolutionary societies) functioning in Maharashtra at that time, which believed in the overthrow of [British rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_raj)  through armed rebellion.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBapu201395-96-4)  In 1904, in a meeting attended by 200 members from various towns in Maharashtra, Swantraveer Vinayak Savarkar renamed it  __ Abhinav Bharat __  , taking after [Giuseppe Mazzini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini) 's [Young Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Italy_(historical) ).[__ [ citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) ]
    - In 1906, Vinayak Savarkar left to London to study law. In the same year, he compiled a volume called  __ Mazzini Charitra __ , a translation of the Italian revolutionary [Mazzini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazzini)'s writings with a 25-page introduction added.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTESharma2006157-5) The book was published in Maharashtra in June 1907 and the first edition of 2,000 copies is said to have sold out within a month.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJoglekar200649-6) Mazzini's techniques of secret societies and guerilla warfare were fully embraced by Savarkar. He wrote regular newsletters to his compatriots in India as well as carrying out revolutionary propaganda in London.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBapu201396-7)
    - Savarkar's revolutionary thoughts led to the assassination of Lt. Col. [William Curzon-Wyllie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Curzon-Wyllie) , the political aide-de-camp to the Secretary of State for India, by Madanlal Dhingra on the evening of 1 July 1909, at a meeting of Indian students in the Imperial Institute in London. Dhingra was arrested and later tried and executed. [A. M. T. Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._M._T._Jackson) , the district magistrate of Nasik, was assassinated in India by Anant Laxman Kanhare in 1909 in the historic "Nasik Conspiracy Case".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBapu201396-7) [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-8)
    - The investigation into the Jackson assassination revealed the existence of the Abhinav Bharat Society and the role of the Savarkar brothers in leading it. Vinayak Savarkar was found to have dispatched twenty [Browning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Browning) pistols to India, one of which was used in the Jackson assassination. He was charged in the Jackson murder and sentenced to "transportation" for life. Savarkar was imprisoned in the [Cellular Jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_Jail) in the [Andaman Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Islands) in 1910.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinav_Bharat_Society#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBapu201396-7)

B. K (Dadasaheb) Gaikwad and[**Dr. B. R. Ambedkar**](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com//2019/04/about-dr-b-r-ambedkar-biography.html)  led a protest outside the temple on **2 March 1930** , in order to allowing [Dalits](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/2019/04/origin-of-untouchability-dalits-and.html)  into the temple.The movement was to have a** right to enter temple** , it was more towards having **equal rights** .
- We don’t want to go to temples though but we should have rights**Kala Ram Temple** is a beautiful temple in Old Nashik area, built by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar in 1788. Thousands of pilgrims visit the temple to take the blessings of Lord Ram.** But until 1930 no **[**dalit**](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/category/caste-system)** or **[**untouchable**](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/2019/04/origin-of-untouchability-dalits-and.html)** was allowed to enter the premises of the temple**. This was because of the rigid [caste system](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/category/caste-system) in India which prevails even today and is practiced since the Rigvedic period.
- It was because of the efforts of some prominent leaders like [Mahatma Jyotirao Phule](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com//2019/04/about-jyotirao-phule-biography-life.html) the struggle for liberation of [Dalits](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/2019/04/origin-of-untouchability-dalits-and.html) was launched in India during the 19th century.After him it was [Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com//2020/01/dr-br-ambedkar-the-man-and-his-message.html), a brilliant lawyer and was educated in United states with the help of scholarship given by Maharaja of Baroda, played a pivotal role in uplifting the [lower caste](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/category/caste-system) and fighting for their equal rights by late 1920s.
    - According to [Babasaheb](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com/category/dr-ambedkar)  Ambedkar in order to break the wall between the upper class and lower caste it was important to get entry into temple because temples have been considered a place of origination of[caste annihilation](https://www.ambedkaritetoday.com//2019/05/the-annihilation-of-caste-speech-by-ambedkar.html) . Thus it became significant to break down the idea by entering the temple. For this movement , [**Kala Ram Temple**](https://studioaddablog.wordpress.com/2018/10/16/kala-ram-temple-satyagraha/)  was chosen.
    - It was this period when Civil Disobedience Movement was initiated by Mahatma Gandhi and thus Satyagraha prevailed in the country.**Dr. Ambedkar initiated Temple Entry Satyagraha**  after three months of painstaking and meticulous efforts in 1930. **It was one of the non violent movement where around 15000 people had participated to get entry into the temple. The Satyagrahis squatted before the temple, singing bhajans but a strong contingent of the Bombay police meted out the non violent Satyagrahis.**
    - **The Bombay police was supported by the orthodox Hindus. These people considered it as an unholy act. Because of this attitude of theirs harsh treatment was given not only to the satyagrahis but also to the untouchables of near by villages**. Their kids were expelled from the school, roads were closed for them, they were not allowed to buy articles of their daily needs from the local market. Despite this provocations, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar kept a check on his Satyagrahis and did not allow them to retaliate.

- [**Chapekar Brothers]**   **Damodar Hari Chapekar** (25 June 1869 – 18 April 1898), **Balkrishna Hari Chapekar** (1873 – 12 May 1899, also called Bapurao) and **Vasudeo Hari Chapekar** (1880 – 8 May 1899), also spelt Wasudeva or Wasudev, were Indian revolutionaries involved in assassinating W. C. Rand, the British Plague Commissioner of [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune), after the public of Pune was frustrated with the vandalism from the officers and soldiers appointed by him, in late 19th century. Mahadev Vinayak Ranade was also an accomplice in the assassination.[ The murder of Leon du Rand - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3meMuYRE5IA)
    - In 1896, the dreaded disease of plague had struck Pune and by early 1897, the disease had spread critically. In February 1897 alone, there were 657 deaths reportedly due to plague. About half of the city’s population had left it.
    - The government set up a Special Plague Committee in March that year to handle the menace and control the spread of the disease. It was chaired by an Indian Civil Service (ICS) officer W. C. Rand.
    - Even though the government had given explicit orders that the religious sentiments of the people be taken care of while inspecting and taking adequate measures and that the people should be especially informed about the good intentions of taking the various strict measures, the commission under Rand paid scant regard to the directions.
    - The commission appointed more than 800 officers and soldiers on duty in Pune rather than employing doctors for the job of implementing the measures. The measures included entry into houses forcefully, the examination of its occupants including women, taking them to segregation camps and preventing people affected with plague from leaving or entering Pune.
    - There were reports that troops indulged in vandalising personal property including religious symbols in the name of controlling the epidemic.
    - People were denied permission to conduct the funerals of their loved ones unless the deaths were registered. If plague was the cause of death, the dead had to be cremated on special grounds designated by the government.
    - People who broke these regulations were subjected to criminal activity.
    - The Chapekar brothers Damodar Hari, Balkrishna Hari and Vasudeo Hari planned to assassinate Rand against whom there was a lot of hatred among the local population.
    - On 22nd June 1897, the British monarch Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee celebrations were being held at Pune. The brothers expected all government officers to arrive for the function.
    - Carrying weapons with them, Damodar, the eldest and Balkrishna, waited for Rand’s carriage to pass by a selected spot on Ganeshkhind Road. Balkrishna shot at Rand and wounded him. Rand’s military escort Lt. Ayerst was also shot at. Ayerst died on the spot while Rand was admitted to a hospital where he died on 3rd July.
    - Damodar was arrested after being informed on by the Dravid brothers. In his statement, he said that he wanted to take revenge for the atrocities committed by British soldiers like the pollution of holy places and the desecration of idols. He was tried and hanged on 18th April 1898.
    - Balkrishna avoided arrest till 1899 when he was caught and tried by the police. He was hanged on 12th May 1899.
    - The third brother Vasudeo and his friends Khando Vishnu Sathe and Mahadev Vinayak Ranade killed the police informants, the Dravid brothers. Vasudeo was hanged on 8th May 1899. Ranade was hanged on 10th May and Sathe, a juvenile, was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment.

- **Subsidiary Alliance **was basically a treaty between the British East India Company and the Indian princely states, by virtue of which the Indian kingdoms lost their sovereignty to the English. It also was a major process that led to the building of the British Empire in India. It was framed by Lord Wellesley, the Governor-General of India from 1798 to 1805. It was actually used for the first time by the French Governor-General Marquis Dupleix.The Nawab of Awadh was the first ruler to enter into the subsidiary alliance with the British after the Battle of Buxar. However, The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to accept a well-framed subsidiary alliance.
    - The subsidiary alliance in India was planned by Lord Wellesley but this term was introduced by French Governor Dupleix
    - An Indian ruler entering into Subsidiary Alliance with the British had to dissolve his own armed forces and accept British forces in his territory.
    - He also had to pay for the British army’s maintenance. If he failed to make the payment, a portion of his territory would be taken away and ceded to the British.
    - In return, the British would protect the Indian state against any foreign attack or internal revolt.
    - The British promised non-interference in internal affairs of the Indian state but this was rarely kept.
    - The Indian state could not enter into any alliance with any other foreign power.
    - He could also not employ any other foreign nationals other than Englishmen in his service. And, if he were employing any, on the signing of the alliance, he had to terminate them from his service. The idea was to curb the influence of the French.
    - The Indian state could also not enter into any political connection with another Indian state without British approval.
    - The Indian ruler, thus, lost all powers in respect of foreign affairs and the military.
    - He virtually lost all his independence and became a British ‘protectorate’.
    - A British Resident was also stationed in the Indian Court.
    - As a result of Indian rulers disbanding their armies, many people were rendered unemployed.
    - Many Indian states lost their independence and slowly, most parts of India were coming under British control.
    - The Nizam of Hyderabad was the first to accept the Subsidiary Alliance in 1798.
    - Lord Clive also introduced the subsidiary system in Oudh and the Treaty of Allahabad was signed where the British promised the Oudh territory from enemies like Marathas.

    - During the 1890s, the caste system in Kerala had the concept of [untouchables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit) . Padmanabhan Palpu, better known as Dr. Palpu, started working towards ensuring the rights of the then identified backward communities. With the 1891 Malayali Memorial Revolt, he took the leadership of the then oppressed community named Ezhava; and attempted to begin an organization called Ezhava Sabha.

- ^^**Madras Mahajana Sabha**^^
    - **Madras Mahajana Sabha**  was an Indian nationalist organisation based in the [Madras Presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Presidency) . Along with the [Poona Sarvajanik Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poona_Sarvajanik_Sabha) , Bombay Presidency Association and the Indian Association, it is considered to be a predecessor of the [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) .
    - The first organisation in the Madras Presidency to agitate for the  rights of Indians was the Madras Native Association which was  established by publicist [Gazulu Lakshminarasu Chetty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazulu_Lakshminarasu_Chetty)  in 1849. This organisation did not survive for long and was eventually disbanded.
    - In May 1884, M. Veeraraghavachariar, G. Subramania Iyer and P.  Anandacharlu established the Madras Mahajana Sabha. The office of the  Sabha functioned in the beginning at the office of The Hindu, Ellis Road  Junction, Mount Road. P. Rangaiah Naidu was elected President of the  Sabha in 1885.

- ^^**British Indian Association**^^
    - **British Indian Association, The**   was founded on October 29, 1851 at Calcutta with Raja [radhakanta dev](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Deb,_Radhakanta)  and [debendranath tagore](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Tagore,_Maharshi_Debendranath)  as its President and Secretary respectively. Other members of the Association included Ramgopal Ghosh, [peary chand mitra](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/Mitra,_Peary_Chand)  and Krishnadas Pal. Its membership was kept exclusive to Indians.
    - The object of the Association was 'to secure improvements in the local  administration of the country and in the system of government laid down  by Parliament'. The Association gave leadership to remove the existing  defects in the laws and civil administration of the country and to  promote greater welfare of the Indians. In 1852 the Association sent a  petition to Parliament 'relative to the East India Company's charter'  fallen due to be renewed in 1853. The Association informed parliament  that Indians were not benefited by their connection with Great Britain  'to the extent they expected'.
    - It submitted a list of grievances, which afterwards became a part of  the Congress demand. These were the relaxation of the pressure of the  revenue systems, the improvement of judicial administration, the  protection of the life and property of the people from molestation,  relief from monopolies of the [east india company](https://en.banglapedia.org/index.php/East_India_Company,_The) ,  encouragement of indigenous manufacture, education of the people and  the admission of the Indians to the higher administrative services. The  Association demanded that in the future two-thirds of Indian Legislative  Council's representatives should be Indians.
    - From its inception the Association had an all-India outlook and  maintained close contacts with associations of similar character, which  were established in Poone, Madras and Bombay. For about quarter of a  century, the Association was the spokesman of India. When the Government  of India put restriction on higher education (1879), the Association  vehemently protested. Being predominantly an organisation of the  landlords and of the upper class, it was obviously concerned with those  measures of the administration that affected their class interests.
    - The exclusive character of the Association and its high rate of  annual subscription came under public criticism. The Muslims of Bengal  who were largely raiyats and peasants had little interest and connection  with this Association. So in order to protect their own interest the  Mohamedan Association was founded in Calcutta in 1856. The British  Indian Association, however, welcomed it. The leaders of this  Association gave their co-operation during the Indian National  Conference (1883 and 1885) and the Conference of the Indian National  Congress (1886) held in Calcutta.
    - In 1859, despite its pro-zamindari and landed aristocracy  interest the Association refused to join the indigo planters in their  efforts to get Act x of 1859 repealed and supported the cause of the  raiyats. In 1860 also it urged the Government to set up a Commission of  Enquiry for solving the question of indigo cultivation.
    - The Indian Association ceased to operate after the abolition of the zamindari system in West Bengal in 1954. [ABM Mahmood]
