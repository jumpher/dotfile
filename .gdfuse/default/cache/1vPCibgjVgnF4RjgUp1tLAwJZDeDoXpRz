Early Kakatiya rulers served as feudatories to [Rashtrakutas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtrakuta_dynasty)  and [Western Chalukyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukya_Empire)  for more than two centuries. They assumed sovereignty under Prataparudra I in 1163 CE by suppressing other Chalukya subordinates in the Telangana region.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakatiya_dynasty#cite_note-:0-5)  Ganapati Deva (r. 1199–1262) significantly expanded Kakatiya lands during the 1230s and brought under Kakatiya control the Telugu-speaking lowland delta areas around the [Godavari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godavari_River)  and [Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_River)  rivers. Ganapati Deva was succeeded by [Rudrama Devi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudrama_Devi)  (r. 1262–1289) and is one of the few queens in Indian history. [Marco Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo) , who visited India some time around 1289–1293, made note of Rudrama Devi's rule and nature in flattering terms. She successfully repelled the attacks of [Yadavas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seuna_(Yadava) _dynasty) (Seuna) of Devagiri into the Kakatiyan territory.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakatiya_dynasty#cite_note-:0-5)
