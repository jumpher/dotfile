- Pabna Peasant Uprising
    - 1873-76 was a peasant revolt
    - against the [lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord)  of the lands in [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal)  ("[zamindars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindars) ") in the Yusufshahi pargana (now the [Sirajganj District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirajganj_District) , [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) ) in [Pabna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabna)
    - It was led by Ishan Chandra Roy.
    - It was supported by intellectuals such as R.C Dutt, Surendranath Banerjee, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, etc.
    - Some lords forcefully collected rents and land  [taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax),  often enhanced for the poor peasants and also prevented the tenants  from acquiring Occupancy Right under Act X of 1859. This Act conferred  occupancy rights on tenants who held land for 12 years as well as paid  their rents. But zamindars didn't want this to happen. The peasants were  often evicted from the land due to non payment. The lords who gained  parts of the [Natore Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajshahi_Raj_family) frequently conducted violent act in order to gain more money. Due to the decline in the production of [Jute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jute) in the 1870s, the peasants were struggling with [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine). Some of the lords declared an enhancement of land taxes and that triggered the rebellion. Some peasants declared their [parganas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pargana) independent of zamindari control and tried setting up a [local government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government) with an "army" to fight the zamindari "[lathials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathi_charge)" or [police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police). Deputies were placed in charge of the rebel army and were stationed at different parts of the district.
    - 
    - When the Pabna Raiyats' League (created in May 1873) activities  threatened public peace, the government intervened to restore peace. In a  proclamation of 4 July 1873 [Sir George campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Campbell_(1824%E2%80%931892)), the then [Lieutenant Governor of Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Bengal),  guaranteed British government support of peasants against excessive  zamindar demands, and advised the zamindars to assert their claims by  legal means only. In the face of police action and additional famine  that broke out in 1873–74, the rebellion subsided.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabna_Peasant_Uprisings#cite_note-1)

- Indigo Revolt [ __ __   __**Nil bidroha**__   __ __  ]
    - The **Indigo revolt**  (or  __ __   __**Nil bidroha**__   __ __  ) was a [peasant movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant_movement)  and subsequent uprising of [indigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_dye)  farmers against the indigo planters that arose in [Chaugacha village of Nadia in Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Presidency)  in 1859.
    - The Biswas brothers of Nadia, Kader Molla of Pabna, and Rafique Mondal of Malda were popular leaders.
    - British police mercilessly hanged great leader of indigo rebels [Biswanath Sardar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biswanath_Sardar)  alias  __  Bishe Dakat __   in [Assannagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asannagar) , Nadia after a show trial.
    - ^^C^^^^auses leading to revol^^t
    - Indigo  planting in Bengal dated back to 1777 when Louis Bonnaud, a Frenchman  introduced it to the Indians.  He was the first indigo planter of  Bengal. He started cultivation at Taldanga and Goalpara near  Chandannagar (Hooghly).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigo_revolt#cite_note-1) With the [Nawabs of Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab_of_Bengal)  under British power, indigo planting became more and more commercially  profitable because of the demand for blue dye in Europe. It was  introduced in large parts of [Burdwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdwan), [Bankura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankura), [Birbhum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birbhum), [North 24 Parganas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_24_Parganas), and [Jessore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessore_(city))  (present Bangladesh). The indigo planters persuaded the peasants to  plant indigo instead of food crops. They provided loans, called dadon,  at a very high interest. Once a farmer took such loans he remained in  debt for his whole life before passing it to his successors. The price  paid by the planters was meagre, only 2.5% of the market price. The  farmers could make no profit growing indigo. The farmers were totally  unprotected from the indigo planters, who resorted to mortgages or  destruction of their property if they were unwilling to obey them.  Government rules favoured the planters. By an act in 1833, the planters  were granted a free hand in oppression.[__ [ citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed) __ ] Even the [zamindars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindars) sided with the planters. Under this severe oppression, the farmers resorted to revolt.
    - The Bengali middle class supported the peasants wholeheartedly. Bengali intellectual [Harish Chandra Mukherjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harish_Chandra_Mukherjee) described the plight of the poor farmer in his newspaper  __ __ [ __The Hindu Patriot__ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindoo_Patriot) __ __ . However the articles were overshadowed by [Dinabandhu Mitra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinabandhu_Mitra), who depicted the situation in his play  __ __ [ __Nil Darpan__ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nil_Darpan) __ __ .His  play created a huge controversy which was later banned by the East  India Company to control the agitation among the Indians.

- Borsad Satyagraha
    - The Borsad satyagraha was over a punitive tax of over Rs 2.40 lakh  imposed on the villages (Gujarat) to pay for additional police forces to  protect against two dacoits of that area – Babar Deva and Ali. In  reality, “the officials were in collusion with the two dacoits” and the  police got a share of the loot! ⁣
    - When Mahatma Gandhi was in  jail, Sardar Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the  police were in league with local dacoits in the Borsad taluka even as  the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoity in the  area. ⁣
    - More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak  and supported the proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed  immoral and unnecessary. ⁣
    - Patel organized hundreds of  Congressmen, sent instructions and received information from across the  district. Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax, and  through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and lands. ⁣
    - After  a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians  believe that one of Patel’s key achievements was the building of  cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities which  were divided on socio-economic lines.⁣
    - After securing victory in  Borsad Satyagraha in 1924, Patel told the locals, “When we make you  fight with the government, you shower much love on us. But the real test  of your love will be when I make you fight with your own limitation.  Government is maya [illusion], a castle in the air, a bubble of water.  It burst as soon as we identify it. But we have blindfolds on our eyes.  So, we haven’t known it in its real form’.⁣
    - Background
        - The Bardoli Taluk in modern-day Gujarat was hit by floods and  famines in 1925, which adversely affected crop yield. This affected the  farmers financially.
        - Ignoring the plight of the farmers, the Bombay Presidency increased the tax rates by 22%.
        - Despite petitions and appeals from civic groups and farmers to  review this unjust hike in tax rates in lieu of the grave situation, the  government decided to go ahead with tax collection.
        - In 1927, the local Congress Party published a report to show that  the farmers could not carry the burden of the enhanced assessment. But  the authorities did not budge.
        - In January 1928, farmers in Bardoli invited Vallabhai Patel to  launch the protest movement wherein all of them resolved not to pay  taxes.
        - They also assured Gandhiji of their commitment to non-violence.
        - Patel agreed to take on the leadership role only after getting  assurances from the farmers of their resolve to the movement. He  informed them of the possible consequences of their move such as  confiscation of land and property and imprisonment.
        - Patel got in touch with the government and apprised it of the  situation. He got the reply that the government was unwilling to make  any concessions.
        - Gandhiji also lend support to the movement through his writings in ‘Young India’ magazine.
    - The Movement
        - Patel was an exemplary commander of his non-violent ‘army’ in Bardoli.
        - He divided the taluk into camps and organised hundreds of men and women under the camps.
        - The volunteers came from Hindu, Muslim and Parsi communities also.
        - From the camps, volunteers issued news bulletins, campaigns and also  made speeches educating the masses about the need to be disciplined and  prepared for austerity.
        - Door-to-door campaigning was also done.
        - A large number of women took active part in the movement. It was these women who gave Patel the moniker ‘Sardar’.
        - Peasants were asked to take oaths in the name of god that they would not pay the taxes.
        - Those who paid taxes or were supportive of the British were socially boycotted.
        - They also worked for the betterment of the Kaliparaj caste (farmers who worked as landless labourers).
        - They refused non-essential goods to government offices in the area.
        - They resisted eviction and confiscation (jabti) in unique ways. They  had informers in the government offices who would give prior  information as to if and when a jabti notice was going to be carried  out. The whole village would then move to another place and the officers  would be faced with an empty village when they arrived to confiscate  the property.
        - K M Munshi and Lalji Naranji resigned from the Bombay Legislative Council.
        - Although the movement was local, it received nation-wide attention and support.
    - Bardoli Satyagraha Effects
    - Effects
        - Fearing things could go out of hand, the government set up the Maxwell-Broomfield commission to look into the matter.
        - The revenue was reduced to 6.03%.
        - The peasants were returned their confiscated land.
        - Patel emerged as a national leader after the success of the Bardoli Satyagraha. He showed his remarkable organising skills.
    - Bardoli Satyagraha Criticism
    - Criticism
        - The movement was focused on the conditions of the rich and middle-class farmers and largely neglected the poor farmers.
        - It is said that the movement was an  experiment on Satyagraha as a method of freedom struggle. The basic  problems of the peasants were not addressed.
        - It did not raise the problem of Hali Pratha (a kind of bonded labour system).
- Nagpur Flag Hoisting {Flag Satyagrah}
    - is a campaign of peaceful [civil disobedience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disobedience)  during the [Indian independence movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement)  that focused on exercising the right and freedom to hoist the nationalist flag and challenge the legitimacy of the [British Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rule)  in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)   through the defiance of laws prohibiting the hoisting of nationalist  flags and restricting civil freedoms. Flag Satyagrahas were conducted  most notably in the city of [Jabalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalpur)  and [Nagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur)  in 1923 but also in many other parts of India.
    - Background
    - The  hoisting of nationalist flags over private and public buildings  (including sometimes government buildings) had been a common nationalist  act of defiance, especially with the [Revolutionary movement for Indian independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_movement_for_Indian_independence) and the members of the revolutionary [Gadar Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadar_Party). Such acts of defiance gained currency across India with the rise of nationalist leaders such, [Bipin Chandra Pal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipin_Chandra_Pal) and [Lala Lajpat Rai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lala_Lajpat_Rai).
    - The  __ Flag Satyagraha __  was a term coined to describe the  hoisting of the flag as a defiance against British-imposed restrictions  on civil freedom and also the legitimacy of British rule in India  altogether. Proliferating during the [Non-cooperation movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement) (1920-1922) and a prominent element of the [Salt Satyagraha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Satyagraha) (1930) and the [Quit India movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit_India_movement) (1942), this means of revolt combined the hoisting of the nationalist flag with the technique of  __ __ [ __Satyagraha__ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha) __ __  — non-violent civil disobedience — as pioneered by [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi). Nationalists were encouraged to violate the law and hoist the flag without resisting arrest or retaliating against police.
    - Flag satyagrahas were one of the most common acts of defiance during the nationalist rebellions led by Gandhi and the [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress)   throughout the struggle. The nationalist flag was regularly heralded by  large processions and nationalist crowds. On 31 December 1929 the  Congress concluded the adoption of the [Purna Swaraj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj)  declaration of independence with Congress President [Jawaharlal Nehru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru)  hoisting the nationalist flag along the banks of the [Ravi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_River) . The flag was also hoisted at the commencement of the Quit India rebellion on 7 August 1942 at [Gowalia Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowalia_Tank)  in [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai)  (then Bombay).
    - The flag satyagraha of Nagpur and [Jabalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalpur)   occurred over several months in 1923. The arrest of nationalist  protestors demanding the right to hoist the flag caused an outcry across  India especially as Gandhi had recently been arrested. Nationalist  leaders such as [Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardar_Vallabhbhai_Patel) , [Jamnalal Bajaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamnalal_Bajaj) , [Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakravarthi_Rajagopalachari) , Dr. [Rajendra Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Prasad)  and [Vinoba Bhave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinoba_Bhave)  organised the revolt and thousands of people from different regions including as far south as the Princely state of Travancore[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Satyagraha#cite_note-1)  traveled to Nagpur and other parts of the [Central Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Provinces)  (now in [Maharashtra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra)  and [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh) )  to participate in civil disobedience. In the end, the British  negotiated an agreement with Patel and other Congress leaders permitting  the protestors to conduct their march unhindered and obtaining the  release of all those arrested.
    - Other notable flag satyagrahas were organised in [Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore) (now in [Karnataka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka))  in 1938 known as Shivapur Dhwaja Satyagraha. Under leadership of  T.Siddalingaih president of Mysore Congress. As a part of state-wide  Satyagraha, the flag was hoisted at Vidurashwatha in Kolar district of  Mysore state, 33 people were killed in open police firing.
    - Several commemorations and reenactments of the rebellions have occurred as part of anniversary celebrations, the [Independence Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(India)) (15 August) and [Republic Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Day_of_India) (26 January).
- **Tebhaga Movement**
    - The **Tebhaga movement**  was significant peasant agitation, initiated in [Bengal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal)  by the [Kisan Sabha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Kisan_Sabha)  (peasant front of the [Communist Party of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India) ) in 1946–47.
    - At that time sharecroppers had contracted to give half of their harvest to the landlords. The demand of the  __ Tebhaga __   (sharing by thirds) movement was to reduce the landlord share to one third.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tebhaga_movement#cite_note-1)
    - In many areas the agitations turned violent, and landlords fled,  leaving parts of the countryside in the hands of Kisan Sabha. In 1946,  sharecroppers began to assert that they would pay only one-third and  that before division the crop would stay in their [godowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godown)  and not that of the [Jotedars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotedar) . The sharecroppers were encouraged by the fact that the [Bengal Land Revenue Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bengal_Land_Revenue_Commission&action=edit&redlink=1)  had already made this recommendation in its report to the government. The movement resulted in clashes between Jotedars and [Bargadars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargadar)  ([sharecroppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharecropper) ).
    - As a response to the agitation, the [Muslim League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League) ministry in the province launched the [Bargadari Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bargadari_Act&action=edit&redlink=1),  which provided that the share of the harvest given to the landlords  would be limited to one third of the total. However, the law was not  fully implemented. The Bengal Land Revenue Commission popularly known as  Floud Commission had made recommendation in favour of the  share-croppers.
- **Eka Movement **
    - Eka=unity movement
    - Initially by Congress+Khilafat Leaders. Later Madari Pasi and other low caste leaders.
    - Reason: oppression by Thekedar. High rents
    - Involved religious ritual, in which farmer would take a tip in Ganges and vow not to do begari, resist eviction etc.
    - Even included some small zamindars who were unhapped with British demands for high revenue.
    - By 1922 severe repression by government=Eka Movement vanished.
    - **Eka Movement**  or **Unity Movement**  is a peasant movement which surfaced in [Hardoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardoi) , [Bahraich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahraich)  and [Sitapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitapur)  during the end of 1921. Initially started by Congress and the Khalifat movement, it was later headed by [Madari Pasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madari_Pasi) .  The main reason for the movement was high rent, which was generally  higher than 50% of recorded rent in some areas. Oppression by  __ thekedars __   who were entrusted to collect rent and practice of share rent also contributed to this movement.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eka_Movement#cite_note-1)
    - The Eka meetings were marked by a religious ritual in which a  hole that represented River Ganga was dug in the ground and filled with  water, a priest was brought in to preside and assembled peasants vowed  that they would pay only recorded rent but pay it on time, would not  leave when ejected, would refuse to do forced labour, would give no help  to criminals and abide by the Panchayat decisions, they would not pay  the revenue without receipt and would remain united under any  circumstance. Small zamindars who were disenchanted with British  Government due to heavy land revenue demand were also a part of this  movement.
    - Soon the leadership of Movement changed from Congress to Madari  Pasi, a low caste leader who was not inclined to accept non-violence.  This led the movement losing contact with nationalist class. Because in  this the national leader was Mahatma Gandhi and his ideology was based  on non violence.
    - By March 1922, due to severe repression by authorities brought the Eka Movement to an end.
    - 
- **Wahhabi Movement**
    - This movement,  _ centred around Patna _   was  an Islamic revivalist movement, whose stress was to condemn any change  into the original Islam and return to its true spirit. The movement was  led by Syed Ahmed Barelvi. The movement was active since 1830s but in  the wake of 1857 revolt, it turned into armed resistance, a  _ Jihad against the British _  .  Subsequently, the British termed Wahabis as traitors and rebels and  carried out extensive military operations against the Wahabis. The  movement was fully suppressed after 1870. British also introduced the  term “sedition” in the Indian Penal Code 1870 to outlaw speech that  attempted to “excite disaffection towards the government established by  law in India”. Thus, this movement marks the beginning of sedition law  in India.
