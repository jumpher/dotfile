- #Governors-General & Viceroys of India
- 
- 
- Introduction
- 
- British rule over India started as a trading unit, when East India Company received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600. Within a time period of nearly three centuries, the British turned from a trading power to one of the most powerful countries in the world.
- Even after being a small island country, Britain was able to establish one of the largest empires in the world. The extent of the empire can be depicted by the phrase that "the empire on which the Sun never sets”.
- Britain was able to achieve this tremendous feat on the backdrop of the strong and efficient bureaucracy that it established in its colonies. In India, the British were able to establish this control through Governor-General & Viceroys.
- Governor-General of Bengal (1773-1833): When East India Company came to India, it controlled Bengal through a post named as "Governor of Bengal" ^^(first Governor of Bengal: Robert Clive).  ^^
    - Other Presidencies, Bombay and Madras, had their own Governor.
        - However, after the passing of Regulating Act 1773, the post of Governor of Bengal was converted into "Governor-General of Bengal" (^^first Governor-General of Bengal was Warren Hastings)^^.
        - Through this Act Governor of Bombay and Madras worked under the Governor-General of Bengal.
    - Governor-General of India (1833-58): By Charter Act of 1833, the post name of Governor-General of Bengal again converted into "Governor-General of India" ^^(first Governor-General of India was William Bentinck^^.
        - This post was mainly for administrative purposes and reported to the Court of Directors of the East India Company.
    - Viceroy (1858-1947): After the revolt of 1857, the company rule was abolished and India came under the direct control of the British crown.
        - Government of India Act 1858 passed which changed the name of post-Governor General of India by Viceroy of India.
        - The Viceroy was appointed directly by the British government.
        - The ^^first Viceroy of India was Lord Canning^^.
