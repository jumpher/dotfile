- **Raja Suheldev**
    - Why in News
        - The Prime Minister has laid the foundation stone of a Maharaja Suheldev memorial and the development work of Chittaura lake in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district.
        - Key Points
        - About Maharaja Suheldev:
            - He was the erstwhile ruler of Shravasti in Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Bahraich district, who ruled in the 11th century.
            - He is known in history for waging guerrilla warfare against Mahmud Ghazni’s large army.
            - Suheldev was deeply moved by the loot and destruction of the  magnificent Somnath temple by invader Mahmud Ghazni that he decided to gather heads of different communities like Tharu and Banjara as well as small kings to block the invasion.
            - His army defeated and killed Ghazi Salar Masud, the nephew of Mahmud Ghazni, at Bahraich.
            - Raja Suheldev finds mention in ‘Mirat-i-Masudi’, a 17th century Persian-language historical account.
            - ‘Mirat-i-Masudi’ is the biography of Salar Masud, written by Abd-ur-Rahman Chishti during the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahangir (1605–1627).
            - In local folklore, Suheldev is said to be a Rajbhar.
            - He is popular as a caste icon among the Rajbhars (OBC) and the Pasis  (second largest Dalit caste in UP), both of whom have been competing  for his legacy and are predominantly found in central and eastern UP.
        - Chittaura Lake:
            - The Chittaura Jheel is located in the Bahraich District near the village Chittaur in Uttar Pradesh.

- **Sucheta Kriplani**
    - ![](%LOCAL_FILE%ApLKYpG3L2k2Ww7ScFpz3wO85eBAYvfPk37vO0BhHprigg1mBF1_uu2UNlejsfQYb-9reo2tPoGqALtoXy25AAow9j1jpMWBukxeycSkdJMMZZaSLp2WyYCrT3cW7n7C.png)
    - Sucheta Kriplani came from the present-day  Haryana and is celebrated for her pivotal role in the Quit India  Movement in 1942. She was also responsible for establishing the Women  Wing in the INC in 1940. She was the first woman Chief Minister of India  when she took over the office from Chandra Bhanu Gupta (Uttar Pradesh)  in 1963. Vijaylakshmi Pandit was the sister of  Jawahar Lal Nehru and her political career had started early and she  served a total of three jail sentences under British rule. She was  appointed as the first woman and became the first Asian to be elected  President of the U.N. General Assembly in 1953. Anne Mascarene  was one of the first women to join the Travancore State Congress and  became the first woman to be part of the Travancore State Congress  Working Committee. She was one of the leaders of the movement for  independence and integration with the Indian nation in the Travancore  State.
- **Women of The Drafting Committe**e
    - The Indian Constitution is notably one of  the most inclusive constitutions in the world. It is also the longest  written Constitution in the world. And it turned out to be this good  because how highly educated and esteemed the panel of the Drafting  Committee was.
        - While the famous names of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad,  Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, etc. dominate the scenario, it is often forgotten  that this committee had representation, no matter how sparse, of women  too and all of them coming from different backgrounds.
        - Of 392 people that were in the committee, only 15 were women.
        - This makes the representation of women less than 4% here. While this  is not ideal, it is important to note the widespread illiteracy and  subjugation, especially amongst women, and caused from pre-existing  societal prejudices and norms, had made it almost impossible for women  to claim a political space. Due to this, the number of educated,  politically strong, and radical women at that time was minimal to say  the least.
        - On the 73rd year of independence, this year, when we  celebrate the long, tireless, and hard struggle of our freedom fighters,  let us also take a moment and celebrate these 15 strong, intelligent,  and crusading women who overcame all social obstacles to put together  one of the most lauded Constitutions of the world.
        - Dakshayani Velayudhan, Hansa Jivraj Mehta, Amrit Kaur, Ammu  Swaminathan, Begum Aizaz Rasul, Durgabai Deshmukh, Kamla Chaudhary,  Leela Roy, Malati Choudhary, Purnima Bannerjee, Renuka Roy, Sarojini  Naidu, Sucheta Kriplani, Vijaylakshmi Pandit, and Annie Mascarene —  these were the 15 women from diverse backgrounds - though and unsurprisingly so, the number of Savarna women was more than that of the Avarna women.
        - Dakshayani Velayudhan, one of the fifteen,  came from the Pulaya community of Cochin and was among the first  generation of women of her community to be both educated and to wear a  ‘upper-cloth’. She was the first and only Dalit woman who was elected to  the Constituent Assembly. She, along with Dr. Ambedkar, brought many  caste-related issues to light in the Assembly debates. She also happened  to be the youngest member of the committee at 34.
        - Elected from Bombay, Hansa Jivraj Mehta was  a member of the Fundamental Rights Sub-committee, the Advisory  Committee, and the Provincial Constitutional Committee. On 15 August  1947, a few minutes after midnight, Mehta, on behalf of the “women of India", presented the national flag to the assembly—the first flag to fly over independent India. She, along with Rajkumari Amrit Kaur,  modelled the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, and fought  for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). She recognised herself as a feminist  and worked extensively in the women’s movement that pushed for the  abolition of child marriage (the Sarda Act), the Devadasi system, for  better educational opportunities for women, and personal law reforms.  She also initiated a number of Constituent Assembly debates, trying to  make the UCC a justiciable part of the constitution. Mehta, Rajkumari  Amrit Kaur, Ambedkar, and Manoo Masani were in strong opinion of UCC  being a part of the state’s responsibility to form a single Indian  identity over the multiple and, often clashing, cultural and religious  identities. However, their motion to pass this as a Right was  overturned.
        - Ammu Swaminathan was elected from the  Madras Constituency and was a firm advocate for the abolishment of the  archaic and oppressive caste system and sided with Ambedkar for several  caste-related issues. Being an upper-caste woman, Ammu recognised the  evil of caste and even criticised Jawahar Lal Nehru for responding to  Panditji which she saw a sign of superior class dominance.
        - Begum Aizaz Rasul was the only Muslim woman  among the fifteen and was elected from U.P. in the Constituent  Commmittee of India. Coming from a family of influential taluqdars of  Oudh (UP), she was one of the few women who successfully contested from a  non-reserved seat and was elected to the U.P legislative assembly.

- **Madari Pasi**
    - 
    - [Eka Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eka_Movement)  had been an offshoot of [Indian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress) , associated with [Non-Cooperation Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement) (NCM).  But when the Congress was busy in the nationwide Non Cooperation  Movement, it somewhat neglected the ongoing Eka Movement. It was this  time when Madari Pasi established himself as a charismatic grassroot  leader among the kisans involved in the Eka Movement. He united the  kisans and petty zamindars from all religions and castes. He pushed the  movement in to a violent route. He violently assaulted zamindars,  karindas, taluqdars and thikadars and even imprisoned them in their own  homes. He began to distribute landowning rights to tenants and petty  landholders. His name was associated with dread.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madari_Pasi#cite_note-4)
    - [Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) with his NCM-[Khilafat Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khilafat_Movement),  after hearing about the violent activities of the Eka Movement members,  disassociated himself from the Eka Movement. After losing the support  of Congress it was much easier for the British authorities to ruthlessly  suppress it. By 1922 the movement was completely suppressed. After the  crackdown Madari Pasi went underground. He tried to associate the  peasants with [Hindustan Socialist Republican Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Socialist_Republican_Association). Even though there is a confusion, it is generally believed that Madari Pasi died on March 27 or 28 in 1931 while underground.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madari_Pasi#cite_note-5)
- Gandhiji
    - After his successful stint in South Africa,  it was time for Gandhiji to try his tactics in his homeland, India. He  tries to experiment with Satyagraha at a smaller scale before he goes  for a mass movement. All his experiments were a huge success and thus  lay the foundation of the Non-Cooperation movement which shook the  British Raj.
    - Champaran Satyagraha – 1917
        - Gandhiji was persuaded by Raj Kumar Shukla to study the conditions of  the Indigo Plantation workers in Champaran, a district in Bihar.
        - The system prevalent in the Indigo Plantations was the Tinkathia System*. In this system, the peasants were required to mandatorily cultivate indigo in 3/20th of their land holdings.
        - Gandhiji did his research. At the same time, the Govt. appointed a  Commission of Inquiry to go into the whole issue and nominated Gandhiji  as one of its members. Needless to say, it found the Planters guilty of  exploitation. A compromise was reached and Planters were ordered to  refund 25% of the amount they had illegally taken.

        - Ahmedabad Satyagraha – 1918
            - This time Gandhiji was dealing with the workers. Due to plague, the  mill owners had increased the pay to 75% to attract workers. However,  once the plague conditions subsided, the mill owners wanted to bring  down the pay to 20%. The workers didn’t agree with this reduction and  wanted 50% of the pay to remain. The logic they sited was that WW1 had  increased the prices. Gandhiji didn’t want the interest of the  industrialist class to be hurt. He tried hard to persuade Ambalal  Sarabhai who was his friend but failed. Left with no option, he asked  workers to go on a strike. When Gandhiji saw the strike subsiding, he  went on a fast. This put pressure on the mill owners who agreed for the  35% increment.
        - Kheda Satyagraha – 1918
            - This is where Gandhiji teams up with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to help  the cause of peasants. The peasants were in extreme distress as their  crop produce had been 1/4th of the original. As per the revenue code,  they were entitled for a full concession. However, the Govt. wasn’t  willing to let go of their revenues and kept pressurizing the peasants.
            - Gandhiji urged all farmers to fight unto death against this injustice  of the British. He appealed the rich farmers to support to the poor  farmers by not paying revenues despite having the capability. Later the  British came out with a policy asking the rich farmers to pay their due  voluntarily. (which backfired as no rich farmer willingly wanted to pay  revenue)
        - Rowlatt Satyagraha – 1919
            - British, in the name of curbing terrorist violence, had introduced a  Bill that severely curtailed the liberties of the Indians. It had  provisions for arrest without warrant and detention for 2 years.  Gandhiji called for a nation-wide hartal accompanied by fasting  and praying. The Movement went in a different direction than what was  expected. There were events of violent outbreaks which feared the Govt.
            - The Rowlatt Satyagraha was withdrawn on 18th April, 1919 because of  the Jaliawala Bagh Massacre that happened on 13th April 1919.
            - Gandhiji called it a ‘Himalayan Blunder’. It should be noted that NCM  was not the first Nationwide Movement, it was the Rowlatt Satyagraha.
    - *There were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij and ryoti. A detailed explanation of the same is given in NCERT.
