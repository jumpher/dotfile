- Kanheri Caves
    - These were the result of architectural pursuits of Mauryan and Kushan rulers from 2nd to 9th  centuries BC. They lie 1500 feet above sea level and are based very  close to the city of dreams- Mumbai. Initially built as rest-houses for  travelers, these got converted to Buddhist viharas. The monks who  initially adapted to the natural settings in the caves, gradually  started carving halls, temples and images of the Buddha and other  Bodhisattvas out of huge rocks, which chanegd the Kanheri caves to an  important Buddhist settlement on the Konkan coast by the 3rd century CE.  The architecture again carries the Buddhist and ancient delicacies  topped with medieval touches. A rock-cut pattern, the caves have been  carved into a hill and house many forms of Buddha. They are 109 in  number with the Cave 3 being most rich with a hall with 34 pillars and  two tall, standing sculptures of Buddha. They give clues to the  Theravada sect of Buddhism.

- Barabara Caves
    - Between second century BC and first  millennium AD, Rock-cut architecture had become the key feature of  Indian architecture. The roots of this architecture are found in Maurya  era. The Mauryan caves were made for Ajivika, Buddhists, Jains as well as the Hindu religions.
    - The first example of rock-cut architecture seems to be a small cave called Son Bhandar at  Rajgir. This is considered to be the site of first Buddhist council and  therefore may be from Pre-Mauryan times. This cave has an oblong  chamber with a crudely vaulted roof and square undecorated doorway
