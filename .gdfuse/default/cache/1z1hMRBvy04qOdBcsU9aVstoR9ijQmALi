- #^^**Background**^^
    - The context behind the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in India was part of a wider trend affecting much of the [Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia)  continent, including the whole of southern and [western Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia) : the ^^influx of ^^[^^nomadic^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad)^^  ^^[^^Turkic peoples^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples)^^  from the ^^[^^Central Asian^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia)  [steppes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppes) . This can be traced back to the 9th century when the Islamic [Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate)  began fragmenting in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East) , where ^^Muslim rulers in rival states began enslaving non-Muslim nomadic ^^[^^Turks^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples)^^  from the Central Asian steppes^^ and raising many of them to become loyal military slaves called [Mamluks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) . Soon, [Turks were migrating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_migration)  to [Muslim lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_lands)  and becoming [Islamicized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamicization) . Many of the Turkic [Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk)  slaves eventually rose up to become rulers, and conquered large parts of the [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world) , establishing Mamluk Sultanates from [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk_Sultanate_(Cairo) ) to present-day [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaznavids) , before turning their attention to the Indian subcontinent.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAsherTalbot200819,_50%E2%80%9351-29)
    - By 962 AD, Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms in [South Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia) faced a series of raids from Muslim armies from [Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia).[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-mrpislam-31) Among them was [^^Mahmud of Ghazni^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_of_Ghazni), the son of a Turkic [Mamluk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk) military slave,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAsherTalbot200819-32)  who raided and plundered kingdoms in north India from east of the Indus  river to west of Yamuna river seventeen times between 997 and 1030.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJackson20033-30-33) Mahmud of Ghazni raided the treasuries but retracted each time, only extending Islamic rule into western Punjab.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-34)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-35)
    - The series of raids on north Indian and western Indian kingdoms by Muslim warlords continued after Mahmud of Ghazni.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-36) The raids did not establish or extend the permanent boundaries of the Islamic kingdoms. In contrast, the^^ ^^[^^Ghurid^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghurid_dynasty)^^ Sultan ^^[^^Mu'izz ad-Din Muhammad Ghori^^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_of_Ghor)^^ (commonly known as Muhammad of Ghor^^) began a systematic war of expansion into north India in 1173.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-37) He sought to carve out a principality for himself and expand the Islamic world.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJackson20033-30-33)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-38) Muhammad of Ghor created a [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni)  Islamic kingdom of his own extending east of the Indus river, and he  thus laid the foundation for the Muslim kingdom called the Delhi  Sultanate.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJackson20033-30-33)  Some historians chronicle the Delhi Sultanate from 1192 due to the  presence and geographical claims of Muhammad Ghori in South Asia by that  time.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-39)
    - Ghori was assassinated in 1206, by [Ismāʿīlī](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism) Shia Muslims in some accounts or by [Khokhars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khokhar) in others.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-40) After the assassination, one of Ghori's slaves (or [mamluks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk), Arabic: مملوك), the Turkic Qutb al-Din Aibak, assumed power, becoming the first Sultan of Delhi.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJackson20033-30-33)

- 
- ^^**A**^^^^**DMINISTRATION OF DELHI SULTANATE**^^^^:^^
    - The Turkish rulers of delhi, as well as their sayyid and lodi successors (with the sole exception of khizr khan), used the title of sultan.
    - They borrowed it from mahummad of ghazini who had assumed independence after freeing himself from the vassalage of samarids and upon whom the title of ‘sultan’ had been conferred by the caliph of Baghdad.
    - Khizr khan recognized the suzerainty of shahrukh, son of timur, and used the title of Rayat-i-a’ala.
    - His son and successor, mubarakh shah, abolished this practice and assumed the title of ‘shah sultan’.
- 
- ^^**Succession**^^:
    - They numbered no less than 28 in 320 years – only 7 of them viz., iltutmish, balban, alauddin, MBT, FST, Bahlul lodi and sikandar lodi, had fairly long reigns.
    - Iltutmish introduced the dynastic principle in to the govt of DS.
    - Iltutmish and his descendents sat on the throne for about 56 years (1210-66).
    - The accession of Ghiyasuddin tughlaq marked the end of the exercise of political power on a tribal basis.
    - At first the turks and then the khalji’s enjoyed previlages as tribal groups; but the sultans of tughlaq dynasty didn’t represent any particular tribe or the interest of any particular racial group.
    - After the end of the tughlaq dynasty, the nobles offered the throne to an influnencial noble named daulat khan; but he was soon replaced by khizr khan to whom timur assigned delhi.
    - Khizr khan and his successors are generally described as sayyids.
    - Bahulal lodis accession marked the revival of a tribal monopoly of political power.
    - The lodis were pure afghans. Not only the political offices but also the army were ‘afghanised’.
- 
- ^^**The idea of kingship**^^:
    - The Iranian poet Firdausi in his Shahnama wrote that the ruler was the representative of god and was endowed with farr, thus he was to be obeyed and respected.
    - Ghazali in his nasihat-ul-mulk also stressed on farr-i-izadi (divine affulgence) i.e., the divine origin of kingship.
    - To justify their rules, the rulers of DS included the Caliphs name in the Khutba and the coins.
    - Except Mubark khalji, none of the rulers called themselves Caliph.
    - Iltutmish treated the great Turkish nobles as his equals and “professed his shyness to sit on the throne”.
    - Balban proclaimed himself as the vice-regent and the shadow of god on earth. He believed that ‘the king’s heart is the mirror of divine attributes’.
    - Alauddin khalji assumed the title of sikandar-i-sani (‘the second alexander’).
    - In his conversation with Qazi Mughisuddin, alauddin clearly stated that he issued command which he “considered to be beneficial to the state and prudent under the circumstances”, without inquiring whether these were permitted by the shariyat or not.
    - Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq softened the harshness of alauddin’s administrative measure.
    - FST reversed the policy of alauddin and thereby weakened the monarchy.
- 
- ^^**The Sultan**^^:
    - The sultan generally discussed all important matters of state in a council, majlis-i-am or majlis-i-khailwat.
- 
- ^^**The nobility**^^:
    - Only two factors which served as practical checks on the royal power: the pressure of the nobility and the influence of the ulema.
    - The nobility was composed of persons of foreign origin but the belonged to two distinct groups: Turkish nobles and non-turkish (taziq).
    - Turks were stronger and they claimed a monopoly of high offices in the state.
    - A2 historian barani, iltutmish had 40 powerful Turkish slaves (Chihalgani) who got the upper hand after his death.
    - Alauddin ignored the racial and hereditary claims of the turks and conferred high offices on nobles whom he considered efficient and trust worthy.
    - Ghiyasuddin tughlaq’s brief reign was a period of harmony between the crown and the nobility.
    - The Sadah amirs, whose revolt led to the rise of the bahmani kingdom, represented an institution of mongol origin. They were officers who combies civil and military functions.
    - The reign of FST was a period of hormany between the crown and the nobility.
- 
- ^^**Central Govt**^^:
    - A2 barani, there are four important ministers, comparable to four pillars, on which the edifice of administration rested. These were, diwani-i-wizarat, diwan-i-arz, diwan-i-insha, diwan-i-risalat.
    - The primacy among the ministers was vested in the wazir, the head of the diwan-i-wizarat.
    - Nizam-ul-mulk Tusi in his book Siyasatnama elaborated upon the quality and functions of the wazir. The wazir, A2 Tusi had to be ahl-i-qalam i.e., a learned man, rather than a warrior.
    - The wazir was assisted by mushrif-i-mamalik and mustaufi-i-mamalik.
    - Mushrif was in-charge of collection of revenue and audited the local accounts.
    - Mustaufi controlled the state expenditure.
    - Iltutmish’s wazir was Fakhruddin Isami, later succeeded by Muhammad Junaidi who opposed Razia. After
    - Razia’s death, Muhazzad Ghaznavi exercised influence till the rise of Balban. Khwaja Hasan was appointed by Balban, followed by Ahmad Ayaz. Balban also appointed Khwaja Khatir as his deputy wazir, who continued as wazir during the time of Jalaluddin and also served Alauddin for some time, Alauddin appointed Nusrat Khan and after him Malik Kafur.
    - Malik Kafur combined the post of wazir and naib-us-sulanat (deputy to the sultanate).
    - During the later Khalji rulers Khusrau malik became the wazir, took the post of naib and later ascended the throne. MBT appointed Ahmed Ayaz (Khan-i-jahan) as wazir.
    - FST appointed khan-i-jahan maqbal, deputy to the previous wazir as his wazir, who was later succeeded by his son jauna khan and was also given the title of khan-i-jahan.
    - During alauddin khalji’s time the number of collectors (amils, mutsarrifs) increased innumerably.
    - He created a new dept called diwan-i-mustkhraj to control them.
    - FST created a separate dept for the collection of sultan’s revenues.
    - The diwan-i-arz was responsible for the administration of military affairs.
    - Ariz-i-mumalik was the head of this department.
    - The diwan-i-insha was headed by dabir-i-khas and staffed by secretaries called dabirs.
    - The minister was in-charge of drafting royal proclamations, official dispatches, letters to provincial governors, officers, etc.
    - The exact functions and duties of diwan-i-risalat have not mentioned in the contemporary accounts and, therefore, there is a difference of opinion about the same.
    - A number of depts came under the preview of diwan-i-risalat. Sadr-i-jahan was incharge of ecclesiastical dept.
    - Muhtasibs or censors of public morals were another set of officials who came under sadr.
    - They were responsible for the proper observance of obligatory duties of the muslim subjects. They also acted as a check on prices, weights and measures.
    - There was a privy council (majlis-i-khas), which the sultans consulted on important matters.
- 
- ^^**Provincial Govt**^^:
    - DS was divided into samller units called wilayat or iqlim or iqta.
    - During alauddin khalji’s reign there were 12 provinces.
    - Provinces were divided into districts or shiqs under shiqdar and further divided into paraganak under alim and village underkhut and muqaddam.
    - The governors of the provinces were called wali, muqti, naib and even sultan, but the last two mentioned titles were applied only to the governors of distant provinces enjoying unlimited powers.
    - The duties of a governor include taking measures for the safety of the roads which were necessary for trade and communication.
    - Delhi sultans appointed sahib-i-dian or khwaja who was the revenue administrator.
    - The smallest unit in the province was a village.
    - A number of villages collectively formed a parganah.
    - A paraganah of 100 villages was called sadi, that of 84 villages was called chaurasi.
    - The chief parganah officer (faujdar) was vested with the responsibility of maintaining peace and order.
    - Balban started the demand for fuwazil (balance of the income).
    - During the early period of MBT’s reign, detailed accounts of income and expenditure of the provinces were taken.
    - Apart from provinces administrated by governors, there were cenrally administered areas (khalisa). There were in charge of officers who functioned under the direct supervision of the wizarat. The delhi territory belonged to this category.
- 
- ^^**Military organizations**^^:
    - Based mainly on Turkish model.
    - The very title of amirs, khans and maliks, with which every official was designated, was a military gradation.
    - Iltutmish was the first Turkish ruler of delhi who thought of organizing the army of the DS as the king’s army, ie., an army centrally recruited, centrally paid and centrally administered.
    - Balban increased the numerical strength of the army.
    - No sultan took greater interest in the army than alauddin khalji. He maintained a large army on a permanent
    - basis and did not disband the soldiers as soon as the campaign was over. .
    - The royal cavalry were called hasham-i-qalb.
    - The troops posted at the provinces came to be known as hasham-i-atraf.
    - Military organization received attention for the first time when balban became the sultan. He increased the power and prestige of the airz, the head of the military dept, and raised him to the ministerial rank.
    - Alauddin also introduced the the system of dagh or branding the horses. The system of chehra was followed and the ariz continued to enroll and keep registers of the army.
    - The most important official concerned with the organization of the army was ariz-i-mumalik and naib-ariz-mumalik.
    - Muster rolls were taken, horses branded and other arrangements were made by the airz or his naib.
    - The amir was incharge of the royal guards of the sultan.
    - Iltutmish gave the soldiers assignments or iqtas as their salary.
    - The soldiers, during the reign of alauddin, used to receive cash payments.
    - FST made it a law that if an officer of the army died he was to be succeeded by his son; if he had no son, by his son-in-law; if he had no son-in-law, by his slave; if he had no slave then by his nearest relation; and if he had no relation, then by his wife.
    - Each fort had its commandant who was generally called the kotwal and he kept the keys of the fort.
- 
- ^^**The Police**^^:
    - Kotwal was the head of the police. They were not the military officers.
    - Balban’s kotwal Fakhruddin and alauddin khalji’s kotwal Ata-ul-mulk played an important role in the administration.
- 
- ^^**Justice**^^:
    - Qazi-ul-Quzzat or chief qazi headed the judicial department, though the sultan was the supreme or highest court of justice and sat in a court called mazalim.
    - The muftis presided over disputes and cases sent to them by qazis.
    - Ibn batuta informs us that MBT sat in the court on every Monday and thrusday.
    - Barani refers to a special court during this time called diwan-i-siyasat specially to deal with the muslim opponents, but this seems to be one of Barani’s many exaggerations.
- 
- ^^**AGRARIAN CONDITION**^^S
    - The administration of the early Turkish sultan in India rested on the foundations of two elements, namely the iqta (the assignment of land revenue) and kharaj (land revenue).
    - Muhammad ghori was the first to introduce the iqta system, but iltutmish gave it an institutional form.
    - In the beginning, the iqta, which was a revenue-yielding piece or area of land, was assigned in lieu of salary, but under FST it became hereditary.
    - The rais means local chiefs.
    - Alauddin was the first sultan of delhi who took a comprehensive view of the agrarian system from the point of view of the central govt and gave it a new shape through elaborate regulations.
    - He bought most of the small iqtas back into the khalisa “by a stroke of the pen”.
    - The standard of the state demand was fixed at one-half of the produce.
    - Barani says that the imposition of the same rate of assessment on the village headman and the ordinary cultivators was due to alauddin’s desire that “the burden of the strong was not to be thrown on the weak”.
    - MBT continued the practice of granting iqtas.
    - For revenue purposes, the land was divided into shiqs and over each shiqs was placed a shiqdar. The shiq in the deccan were larger than those in northern India.
    - The early revenue measures of FST are recorded in barani. First, kharaj and jeziah were collected according to the “rule of produce”.
    - In delhi the jeziah was a personal tax – a fixed sum per head payable in cash. In rural areas, however, it probably varied with the rate of land revenue.
    - The digging of canals was the most important aspect of FST’s constructive policy in the agrarian sector.
    - Assignments were made to military officers and soldiers.
    - Under the lodis, assignments were fewer in number, but large and more lucrative, sikandar lodi adopted one uniform yard of forty-one digits as the standard unit of measurement.
    - Ibrahim lodi issued an order that the revenue should be taken from the cultivators only in kind.
- 
- ^^**REVENUE SYSTEM UNDER THE SULTAN**^^S
    - Iltutmish divided the kingdom into iqtas amongst his soldiers and nobles as their remuneration for the services.
    - Balban, however, could not bring about any effective change in them owing to the appeals of Malik-ul-Umra Fakhruddin, the kotwal of delhi.
    - Balban took another step to supervise iqta holders. He appointed his sons to important provinces as governors and created the office of khwaja. It was a sort of diarchy, though in a very limited sense, created by balban. Though muqta was chiefly the in-charge and khwaja his subordinate.
    - Dr. R.P. Tripathi suggests that Khwaja was a civil official and had to deal with accountants and records.
    - The delhi country comprising mainly of the khalisa land directly under the revenue ministry, and the river country of the doab under the governors.
    - There were three modes of assessments: 1. compounding 2. sharing and 3. measurement.
    - During the reign of alauddin the most important change effected was in the mode of assessment. He insisted on actual measurement of land.
    - Alauddin raised the scale of taxation to the highest point (1/2). He also imposed a ‘grazing tax’ called charai.
    - For the realization of arrears of revenue alauddin created a branch in the wizarat called mustkhraj.
    - The khuts and muqaddams were hard hit, driven to impoverishment.
    - Unlike alauddin, ghiyasuddin granted certain concessions to the khuts and muqaddams.
    - One of the most important steps taken by Ghiyasuddin was that he ordered that the demand should be made on the actual produce (hasil). This was definitely a very statesman-like step taken by ghiyasuddin because it clearly provided for concessions in cases of crop failures and other unforeseen calamities.
    - MBT continued the old custom of granting iqtas was continued and muqtis and amils continued to serve the purpose of revenue collection.
    - FST attempted to increase his income by means of improved quality of cultivation and superior crops, by means of haqqi-i-sharb or water tax, over and above kharaj, on land irrigated by canals (its scale being one-tenth) and by income of gardens.
    - FST roughly built 1200 gardens in and around delhi.r
