## If you want to synchronize calcurse with a CalDAV server using
## calcurse-caldav, create a new directory at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
## (~/.config/calcurse/caldav/) and $XDG_DATA_HOME/calcurse/caldav/
## (~/.local/share/calcurse/caldav/) and copy this file to
## $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/calcurse/caldav/config and adjust the configuration below.
## Alternatively, if using ~/.calcurse, create a new directory at
## ~/.calcurse/caldav/ and copy this file to ~/.calcurse/caldav/config and adjust
## the configuration file below.

#[General]
## Path to the calcurse binary that is used for importing/exporting items.
#Binary = calcurse
#
## Host name of the server that hosts CalDAV. Do NOT prepend a protocol prefix,
## such as http:// or https://. Append :<port> for a port other than 80.
##Hostname = apidata.googleusercontent.com
#
## Path to the CalDAV calendar on the host specified above. This is the base
## path following your host name in the URL.
##Path = /caldav/v2/bhismaonlinehe@gmail.com/events/
#
## Type of authentication to use. Must be "basic" or "oauth2"
#AuthMethod = oauth2
#
## Enable this if you want to skip SSL certificate checks.
#InsecureSSL = No
#
## Disable this if you want to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
## Using plain HTTP is highly discouraged.
#HTTPS = Yes
#
## This option allows you to filter the types of tasks synced. To this end, the
## value of this option should be a comma-separated list of item types, where
## each item type is either "event", "apt", "recur-event", "recur-apt", "todo",
## "recur" or "cal". Note that the comma-separated list must not contain any
## spaces. Refer to the documentation of the --filter-type command line argument
## of calcurse for more details. Set this option to "cal" if the configured
## CalDAV server doesn't support tasks, such as is the case with Google
## Calendar.
#SyncFilter = cal,todo
#
## Disable this option to actually enable synchronization. If it is enabled,
## nothing is actually written to the server or to the local data files. If you
## combine DryRun = Yes with Verbose = Yes, you get a log of what would have
## happened with this option disabled.
#
## Enable this if you want detailed logs written to stdout.
#Verbose = Yes
#
## Credentials for HTTP Basic Authentication. Leave this commented out if you do
## not want to use authentication.

##Username = user
##Password = pass

## Optionally specify additional HTTP headers here.
